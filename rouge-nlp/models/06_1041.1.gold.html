("holdings") for $625,000. on the same day holdings executed a declaration of trust in favour of k., v. and the debtor ("the beneficiaries") declaring that it held the land for the beneficiaries in equal shares as tenants in common. in june 1974 holdings executed a memorandum of mortgage over the land in favour of the petitioning creditor to secure repayment of $275,000 together with interest. the obligations of holdings under the mortgage were guaranteed by k. and the debtor. in november 1976, holdings having defaulted in payment of interest, the petitioning creditor issued a writ against holdings, k. and the debtor, and subsequently issued a second writ and consolidated the two sets of proceedings. in the supreme court judgment was given in favour of the petitioning creditor from which judgment both parties appealed. the court of appeal dismissed the appeal of k. and the debtor and allowed the cross appeal of the petitioning creditor. as a consequence of the non-payment of the judgment debt due to the petitioning creditor a bankruptcy notice was issued in which the petitioning creditor claimed: "the sum of $461,522.73 together with interest thereon at the rate of twenty-two per cent per annum from 15th february, 1978, which at the date of issue of this notice amounts to $93,189.65 making a total $554,712.38 is due by you to it under final judgment obtained by it against you in the supreme court of new south wales on 15th february, 1978, as varied by a final order of the supreme court of new south wales court of appeal on 14th december, 1978, being a judgment and a final south wales court of appeal on 14th december, 1978, being a judgment and a final order the execution of both of which have not been stayed."</a>
