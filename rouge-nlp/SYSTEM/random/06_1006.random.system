3 the tribunal found that the appellants claims lacked the necessary detail to establish relevant facts sufficient to establish refugee status, and in particular that it was not satisfied that the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution.
the appellants advanced the following details in support of those assertions: first that the appellant husband was persecuted by muslims because of his political popularity; secondly that the appellants were unable to collect documentary evidence; thirdly that the tribunal did not provide the appellants with adequate particulars of the independent country information; fourthly that the tribunal did not provide the appellants with adequate opportunity to respond to the substance of this information; fifthly that the information used by the tribunal did not show that congress politicians are safe; sixthly that the appellants did not get an opportunity to attend the tribunal hearing because they were not informed of the consequences of non-attendance or the hearing procedure; seventhly that the appellants needed an opportunity to give oral evidence and the decision of the tribunal was affected by a lack of procedural fairness; and eighthly, that since the appellants had been persecuted by the bjp, it would not be possible for them to relocate in india.
7 at the hearing of the appeal in this court, the appellant was unable to demonstrate, nor did he seek to demonstrate, error in any of the tribunal's reasoning, but instead sought an adjournment to enable he and his wife to obtain evidentiary material from india in refutation of the tribunal's findings.
