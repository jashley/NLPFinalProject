the reasoning of moore j in his judgment of 14 october 2008 shows that his honour applied s 56 of the act and o 28 of the rules, and the relevant general principles relating to security for costs as formulated in equity access limited v westpac banking corporation (1989) atpr 40-972 at 50, 635, as well as the observations of spender j in tait v bindal people [2002] fca 322 at [3] - [4] .
on the question of jurisdiction, it is submitted on behalf of mr soh that the way in which his honour's order of 14 october 2008 operated was that first there had to be non-compliance with the direction, and that if the matter were to be dismissed it was necessary for the commonwealth to bring the matter back before the court and seek a specific order based on that failure and only after establishing non-compliance.
in particular, moore j noted that the appellant was outside the jurisdiction with no assets in australia and that he was clearly impecunious.
