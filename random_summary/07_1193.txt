23 however, i do agree with the appellant's contention that the "findings and reasons" of the tribunal do not specifically deal with the general discrimination point.
in my view, the question of the applicant's membership of the buddhist religion is squarely on the agenda, and, in my view, the tribunal's findings deal with both issues.
the acknowledgment of the applicant's general claims of discrimination amounting to persecution directed towards buddhists in bangladesh appears throughout the tribunal's decision.
