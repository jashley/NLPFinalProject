views on whether or not particular decisions or conduct constitutes a reviewable decision have not always been unanimous (for example, guss v federal commissioner of taxation [2006] fcafc 88 ; (2006) 152 fcr 88).
secondly, the examples of decision listed in the extended definition contained in s.3(2) are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute or, in the words of deane j., "a determination effectively resolving an actual substantive issue ".
the conduct complained of did not constitute a reviewable decision as it was not a substantive determination.
