i also endorse mr boge's submission that yet another expert report, even by a senior consultant anthropologist, would not endorse the native title application currently filed.
the notice of motion is dismissed.
5 i made orders last september which recognised that the native title claim was flawed and contemplated that either the applicant discontinue the application or that the application be dismissed in lieu of a notice of motion to amend the application.
