the jurisdiction of this court on appeal is to correct error by the federal magistrates court in its judicial review of the rrt's decision for jurisdictional error.
to the contrary, the appellant's evidence was at the forefront of the rrt's assessment.
i am satisfied that the federal magistrates court's assessment of this first ground of review is correct.
