apart from that i do not know what costs will be associated with taxing the bill of costs.
at the end of the day, i am not satisfied that the applicants have demonstrated circumstances that justify my exercising my discretion to fix a gross sum for the costs i have ordered under o 62, rule 4(2)(c).
but that will only apply if i accede to the application made in paragraph three of the notice of motion that i fix those costs in the sum of $10,000.
