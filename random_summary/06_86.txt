accordingly, the application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal is refused with costs.
that judgment concerned an application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal of 17 june 2003.
the application was dismissed by the federal magistrate as incompetent, because the federal magistrate concluded that the tribunal's decision was a privative clause decision and in relation to such a decision applications had to be made within specified times.
