introduction 1 this proceeding concerns the construction of s 160zh(3)(c) of the income tax assessment act 1936 (cth) ('the act').
the appellants submitted that the shares increased in value following the expenditure and the expenditure was therefore reflected in the state or nature of the shares at that time, continuing through to the time of disposal.
32 the purpose of s 160zh(3)(c) is to allow a taxpayer to take into account in calculating the cost base of an asset, the capital cost incurred for the purpose of enhancing the value of the asset where the expenditure is later reflected in the state or nature of the asset at the time of its disposal.
