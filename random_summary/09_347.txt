as i have found that no case has been made out to order security for costs i do not think it would be appropriate to hold mr stojanoski to the undertaking which was offered.
" skiwing has sought damages under s 82(1) of the tp act.
counsel for skiwing indicated that mr stojanoski was prepared to give an undertaking to be personally responsible for any costs ordered against skiwing although he was not prepared to volunteer security for costs either in his personal capacity or if joined as an applicant in the proceedings.
