2 the affidavit of ms heath does not exhibit any written confirmation of any of these oral arrangements.
however, i should emphasise that unless these arrangements are documented in a properly enforceable form and there is a serious prospect that the funds will be paid and cleared by 14 march 2008, then the real probability is that on 12 march 2008 i will make orders for winding up.
however, i am satisfied that a special circumstance exists in the form of the intervention of these proposed arrangements.
