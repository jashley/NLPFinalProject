56 counsel for the applicant movers referred me to my decision in sambo v state of western australia (2008) 172 fcr 271 ( sambo ), where i held that s 66b of the act was the only process by which an applicant in a native title determination may be replaced.
the applicant will continue to utilize the services of swalsc.
the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that there has been a notification to members of the native title group as defined or that those who attended belonged to it.
