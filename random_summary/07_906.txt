substantial costs have been incurred by the applicant in meeting an application for security for costs which was doomed to fail.
i would only say that there does seem to be force in the submission of mr mcgowan sc that the respondents are in a real sense the moving party since in their cross-claim they seek removal of the applicant's trade marks, which is something they would have to achieve anyway to obtain registration of their own marks.
it is not necessary therefore to say anything about the applicant's submissions as to the substantive merits of the respondents' case or the quantum of the amount of security sought.
