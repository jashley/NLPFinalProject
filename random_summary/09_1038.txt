i do not consider that decision advances the position of the acc in this matter.
in hammond , gibbs cj at 198 said: once it is accepted that the plaintiff will be bound, on pain of punishment, to answer questions designed to establish that he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged, it seems to me inescapably to follow, in the circumstances of this case, that there is a real risk that the administration of justice will be interfered with.
however, a full answer to those questions may have directly provided information concerning facts and matters relating to the charge.
