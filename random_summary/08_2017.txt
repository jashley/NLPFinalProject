thirdly, there is evidence before me that raises serious doubts in my mind as to whether mr stirrup has misled mr duncan, one of the joint administrators, and as to whether he may be trying to use the administration to allow him to gain access to assets of the company.
mr stirrup also says that he and his wife will not prove any debt that arises as a result of them paying any of the company's debts.
i infer from this statement that mr stirrup was apparently willing to dispose of the assets of total, which he thought were worth $1 million, to mr robinson, for the price of $500,000.
