what i propose to do is to make a further order that jlcs, lionel and joel be restrained from permitting any person to use the squires loft mark in relation to, or in connection with, the city grill room.
in my view an area of exclusivity being the area bounded by (and including) collins street, swanston street, la trobe street and king street is reasonable.
i have not heard argument on this issue, but it is a point to which the parties should have regard if it is to be again alleged that jlcs, lionel and joel are in breach of the orders made against them.
