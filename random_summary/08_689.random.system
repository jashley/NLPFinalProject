on 29 november 2007, his honour made orders dismissing the application for non appearance pursuant to rule 13.03a(c) of the federal magistrate court rules 2001 (cth) (see: mzxpw v minister for immigration and citizenship [2007] fmca 2044).
as a result the tribunal found that the appellant had never converted as claimed, and had not been forced out of home, beaten or threatened.
accordingly, it is inappropriate that leave to appeal should be granted.
