2 the applicant in the proceedings before the federal magistrate sought to review a decision evidenced by a letter to the applicant's solicitors dated 3 september 2007.
as you may be aware, while section 417 of the act provides the minister with the power to substitute for a decision of the refugee review tribunal a decision more favourable to the applicant, it is a non-compellable power.
there is no suggestion in the evidence that the minister intended anything other than that provided the officer in good faith formed the view that the 'unique or 'exceptional circumstances' criterion was not met, the minister did not wish to consider exercising his s 417(1) power.
