i certify that the preceding five (5) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice allsop.
i have had argument before me as to the admissibility of expert evidence in professional cases.
there is a body of authority, best illustrated by the judgment of austin j in australian securities and investments commission v vines (2006) 58 acsr 298 which rejects evidence in professional negligence cases where the expert evidence does not direct itself to the developed practice amongst competent professionals.
