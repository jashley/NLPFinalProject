i do not understand nsx to contend that its directors did "convene" (as distinct from "call") the general meeting scheduled for 27 may 2009 any earlier than when the notices of general meeting were dispatched on 27 april 2009.
i need not decide the correct meaning of "do not do so" in s 249e(1) because in my opinion the directors did not even call the meeting within the 21 day period.
legislation sections 249d and 249e of the corporations act 2001 (cth) (the act) are of critical importance.
