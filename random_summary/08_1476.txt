the applicant's complete application for the innovation patent was filed as a divisional application under section 79b of the patents act 1990 (cth), relying on the standard patent application as the first-mentioned application for the purposes of that section.
28 i reject the applicant's argument that the respondent's construction creates an anomaly by providing the innovation patent with the benefits of divisional status whilst depriving it of the grace period benefits otherwise accruing to that status.
in other words, cl 2.2(1a) applies in circumstances where it will never be the complete application that first discloses the invention.
