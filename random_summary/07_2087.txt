on 30 september 2005, you lodged your income tax returns for the years ended 30 june 1997 to 30 june 2003.
until 30 june 1998 the relevant obligation to remit the amounts deducted to the commissioner was to be found in s 221f of the assessment act.
in my opinion it was not incumbent upon the respondent to afford the applicant an interview before making the determinations which she made.
