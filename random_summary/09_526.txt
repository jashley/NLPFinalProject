ground three before me is that "the refugee review tribunal failed to assess the possibility of the risk the applicant face if he return to china (sic)".
it is not open on this appeal to seek a further review of the merits of the appellant's case in this court.
there is no discernable error on the part of the federal magistrate in his decision.
