her honour thereby refused an application for an order nisi in respect of a decision of the refugee review tribunal handed down on 19 january 2001, which in turn had earlier confirmed the refusal of the minister's delegate on 23 october 1998 to grant the applicant a protection visa.
the grounds for appealing that decision were stated as follows: '&#8226; the federal court erred in law not to find the lack of procedural fairness in the proceedings of the refugee review tribunal (the tribunal), in that the tribunal did not give the opportunity to respond to the independent evidence in the possession of the tribunal which suggested to the tribunal it is possible to be involved in the political activities in bangladesh in the circumstances of the appellant (me), without a victim of violence and/or which otherwise suggested to the tribunal that i am not a refugee within the meaning of the refugee convention.
&#8226; the tribunal did not consider the risk of harm and persecution i experienced were politically motivated.
