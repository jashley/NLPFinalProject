he, therefore, refused both the application for leave to appeal the decision of logan j and, as a necessary consequence, the application for mr spencer to have leave to act as a director under s 471a of the act: at [19].
i note in passing that ms walker has pointed out that, in the lead up to the hearing on 3 august 2009, directions were given that made it clear that there would be no further adjournment of the matter beyond 3 august 2009.
mr spencer has submitted that that decision should be distinguished, because: the hearing before greenwood j was vitiated by it being determined "on the papers" when an appearance was required.
