aurora seeks declarations that (i) the commonwealth is required to indemnify it in respect of any damages awarded to mr fowle against it for injuries suffered by him in october 1997 and that (ii) it is not liable to repay the commonwealth or comcare any monies paid by them in respect of workers compensation to mr fowle arising from the injuries suffered by him in october 1997.
the hydro enjoyed no statutory protection comparable to that in s 45 of the commonwealth act.
