given that there is nothing at all to be gained from continuing to defend this case because the first and second respondents ceased trading in this type of business years ago, the parties have consented to the attached orders.
in my opinion, there are problems with this construction of paragraph 12.
but in all the circumstances, i am not prepared to find that mr spencer committed a contempt by the way in which he endeavoured to comply with paragraph 12 of the orders.
