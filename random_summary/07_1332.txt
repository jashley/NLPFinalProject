some time in 2001 mr. gopinathan contacted me and told me he had left rapid building systems india and that he had moved to chennai.
kirsten informed me that a meeting was held with zwaans, kirsten, dhananjayn, gopinathan and ramesh during the week commencing 6 september 1999.
25 in april 2006 kirsten wrote to zwaans seeking payment of the applicants' commission as their "efforts have brought you success in india".
