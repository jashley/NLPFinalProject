&#8226; the decision of jarrett fm on the substantive hearing has no relevance to this appeal.
in fact, the appellant submits, no registered mail was ever produced, and a credible reason why the appellant never received the notice of decision was that it had never been posted.
in my view, the circumstances of this case do not warrant departure from the usual order that costs should follow the event.
