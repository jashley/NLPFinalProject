the federal magistrate also set out in his reasons a passage from the joint judgment of the high court in the case of bodruddaza v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs (2007) 228 clr 651 ( bodruddaza ).
in my view, the mere fact that a party has raised constitutional arguments will not result in the litigation being treated as "public interest litigation".
the appellant is correct in her contention that the validity of the impugned provisions of the act and regulations was never in issue in bodruddaza and that, therefore, the high court did not consider the validity of those provisions in that case.
