the tribunal made no finding that her daughter had lived in australia throughout the period that it found that mrs baccon had been an australian resident.
it is not a term of art; the precise meaning of expressions such as 'resident' , 'resides in' and 'is residing in' in legislation will depend upon the context provided by, and the purpose of, that legislation.
