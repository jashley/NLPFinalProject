these are that the ceo is satisfied, having regard to the application and any other information that the ceo considers relevant, that the application complies with the formal requirements in s 269zhc and there appear to be reasonable grounds for asserting that the expiration of the anti-dumping measures to which the application relates "... might lead, or might be likely to lead, to a continuation of, or a recurrence of, the material injury that the measures are intended to prevent".
this context suggests that the parliament used "likely" to convey "more probable than not", rather than a lesser degree of certainty.
the notice must inform persons that, relevantly, an existing dumping duty notice (such as that in the present case) is due to expire on a specified day and invite interested parties to apply to the ceo in accordance with s 269zhc within 60 days for a continuation of those measures (s 269zhb(1)).
