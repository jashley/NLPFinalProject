it is difficult to see how his honour was in error in failing to take account of a transcript that was not before him or of the fact that that transcript was not yet available.
that affidavit included a paragraph stating in general terms that the respondent was attempting to prevent mr conley from pursuing further claims in the supreme court.
thank you.
