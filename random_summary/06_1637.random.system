5 it is apparent from the affidavit of judith goh that a substantial part of her case rests on earnings she says she received and payments she says she made out of those earnings.
4 on 2 november 2006 the plaintiff filed a notice of motion seeking orders that discovery be made of judith's taxation returns and any documents from the company's accountant relating to the preparation of its taxation returns and financial reports.
3 judith goh's defence is that by a minute of the company dated 31 march 2004, she was appointed as a director and provided with a share allocation.
