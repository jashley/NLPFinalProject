28 in my view, therefore, there is no error apparent in barnes fm's decision and, it follows, no justification for granting leave to appeal that decision.
g) on the other hand, an order that stays or dismisses an action or refuses leave to commence or proceed with an action because the action is frivolous, vexatious, an abuse of the process of the court or does not disclose a reasonable cause of action is an interlocutory order.
in the absence of anshun estoppel or res judicata, such a dismissal does not involve a final determination of the rights of the parties, but rather a conclusion that the relevant body or court has no jurisdiction to determine those rights whatever they may be.
