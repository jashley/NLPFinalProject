whilst it may be assumed that the applicant will claim pursuant to s 30(4)(c) that answers in response to questions directly relevant to the charge might tend to incriminate him, so that his own answers would not be admissible in relation to the charge, other evidence procured during the investigation may be admissible and be conveyed to the prosecuting authority pursuant to s 12(1).

both their honours expressed their conclusion as following from the fact that the answers may tend to prejudice an accused in the defence of the criminal charge.
