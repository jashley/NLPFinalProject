but again there is no rule to that effect and again, for the reasons already mentioned, nor could there be.

clause 4.7(d) provides: 4.7 the lessor and the lessee must pay their own costs relating to the preparation, negotiation and completion of this lease, but the lessee must pay to the lessor on demand: ... (d) the lessor's legal and other costs (on a full indemnity basis) in relation to: (i) any application for consent required under this lease (whether or nor the consent is given); (ii) any surrender or early termination of this lease; (iii) any litigation or arbitration in which the lessor is made a party or is otherwise involved, arising directly or indirectly out of this lease or the lessee's occupancy of the premises (except where a court or arbitrator awards costs in favour of the lessee against the lessor); and (iv) default by the lessee or the lessee's invitees under this lease.
