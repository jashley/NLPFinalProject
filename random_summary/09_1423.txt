i have not considered closely the question of whether an order is absolutely necessary in the circumstances but what is clear is that the legislative effect of item 6 of sch 4 to the acma act provides in subs 1 that (subject to sub-item(2)), if any proceedings to which the australian broadcasting authority (aba) or the aca was a party were pending in any court or tribunal immediately before the transition time, acma is to be substituted for aba or aca from the transition time as a party to the proceedings.
it was as a result of that legislative change that the applicant's solicitors chose to use the name acma in place of the name aca from dates after 1 july 2005.
in accordance with item 6(1) of schedule 4 to the australian communications and media authority (consequential and transitional provisions) act 2005 (cth) the australian communications and media authority is substituted for the australian communications authority as the applicant herein, that substitution is to take effect from 1 july 2005.
