321 dr watson considered that the results in csi 118 were very suspect and that it would be inaccurate to use the data from csi 118 in isolation.
however, according to both dr scallen and dr roth, both in vitro and in vivo testing have important roles to play in drug discovery programs such as that undertaken by warner-lambert in relation to its testing for new hmg-coa reductase inhibitors.
dr scallen said that even before the us equivalent to the 981 patent was published in 1987, he knew from general principles of medicinal chemistry that only one enantiomer of any compound that was synthesised as a potential hmg-coa reductase inhibitor would be expected to be active in the target biological system.
