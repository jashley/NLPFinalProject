document 11 in this communication i seek advice from and provide instructions to my lawyers.
it contains advice and confirmation of previous instructions.
whatever was the substance of the communications made by williams &amp; hughes to mr gurtler and mr van noort which related to the decision to join mr turnbull and which are listed in mr gurtler's affidavit, there is on the material before me no reasonable grounds for believing that legal advice contributed to that decision: cf southern equities corporation ltd (in liq) v arthur anderson &amp; co (1997) 70 sasr 166 at 175-176.
