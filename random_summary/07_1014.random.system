a meeting was then held at which a special resolution was passed that hicom sales be wound up under a members' voluntary liquidation.
it seems to me that an order under s 1322(4) would achieve the aims of the liquidator to ensure that the windings up are to be treated as members' voluntary windings up.
section 494(1) provides that a majority of directors of a company may make a written declaration to the effect that they have made an inquiry into the affairs of the company and that they have formed the opinion that the company would be able to pay its debts in full within a period not exceeding 12 months after the commencement of the winding up of the company.
