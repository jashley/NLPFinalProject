how could a man with your experience and position with the bank decided to dismiss me from my employment because andrew matthews has denied signing letter dated 24/12/2007.
to ensure that there are no ongoing problems between myself and mr porter, or anyone in his management line, please authorise a transfer of my position to either the eastern region or personal relationship banking.
and my name absolutely been blackened in that file.
