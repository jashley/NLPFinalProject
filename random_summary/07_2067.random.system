interestingly, rares j went on to say that: "even if the court is unable to determine this question on a review under s 21 of the act, s 22 of the federal court of australia act requires that the court grant either absolutely, or on such terms and conditions as it thinks just, all remedies to which any of the parties appear to be entitled.
