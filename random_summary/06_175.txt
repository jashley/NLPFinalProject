on this basis, i am not persuaded that the further material provided by the appellant should be admitted into evidence on principle in the context of this appeal, although having read the same for the purpose of so ruling, i do not think that its content, even if unchallenged, could have materially or conceivably advanced the appellant's case on the appeal to any significant extent.
i was referred in particular to well-known established authorities governing the reception of fresh evidence and governing the discretionary grant or refusal of relief.
in that regard, the evidence disclosed that the appellant's sister became aware of the tribunal's adverse decision by at least 1 may 2003, and that the appellant was living with her at least 'from around' that time.
