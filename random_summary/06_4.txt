23 on 14 january 2003, the applicant lodged an application for a protection visa with the respondent.
the tribunal purported to make the decision of the tribunal without jurisdiction because: (a) it made an adverse finding against the applicant founded on what it said was his explanation for the fact that he made no mention of having been abducted by the lord's resistance army ("lra") in his application for the visa whereas the applicant did mention having been abducted by the lra in the application; (b) it made adverse findings against the applicant founded on the erroneous adverse finding referred to in subparagraph (a); (c) in the premises, the tribunal failed to review the decision of the delegate in accordance with section 414 of the migration act or at all.
if the possibility exists that the appellant, if given the opportunity might be able to make submissions or call evidence which could affect the outcome, the appellant will not fail merely because the appellant has not proved that the submissions or evidence would affect the outcome.
