25 in belan v casey [2002] nswsc 58 ( 'belan' ) at [15]-[21], young cj in eq held that since the house of lords decision in bolkiah the overwhelming weight of authority establishes that the jurisdiction of the court to intervene at the suit of a former client to restrain a solicitor from acting is founded solely on the real risk of disclosure of confidential information, and is not connected with some principle of conflict of interest.
it stated that the deans were not consulted by their fellow directors of gss in relation to any appointment of ohd and that, in any event, ohd had a clear conflict of interest in acting on behalf of gss when it had previously acted, and still acted, on behalf of the landmark interests.
if these matters are put in issue, vogrig will almost certainly be a material witness.
