mr doelle did not give sworn evidence that this document comprised part of the record before the aat, and, in a statement which he made from the bar table, was unable to confirm one way or the other whether it was, indeed, part of the material before the aat.
paragraph 8 of the ssat's reasons is as follows: mr doelle and his solicitor, mr mcghie, spoke to the tribunal and the following is a summary of the information provided: what the aat observed in its reasons (para 11) in respect of the evidence concerning the composition of the settlement moneys was as follows: it appears from the evidence in this matter that the applicant agreed with parts of paragraph 8 of the ssat's decision regarding economic loss being claimed as a component of his settlement by his solicitor at and during the negotiations that led to the settlement of his injuries claim for $55,000.
it seems to me to follow, having regard to the observation made by brennan j in waterford's case, that it would be impermissible, on an appeal from the federal magistrates court which had entertained an appeal under s 44 of the administrative appeals tribunal act , to receive, by way of an endeavour to supplement the record, material which could only go to a challenge to the factual conclusion reached by the aat.
