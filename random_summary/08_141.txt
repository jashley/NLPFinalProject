the orders sought have been refined to include an order that the receiver and manager appointed provide a report within 21 days of the appointment as to the assets and liabilities of apd and what should be done to preserve its business.
that accommodates my concern about the terms of the order made on 2 november 2007 discussed above.
i also propose, for the reasons i have given, to restrain apd from selling or offering for sale the wingfield property or the other assets of apd without giving notice in writing of seven days to the solicitors for the plaintiffs, which notice should indicate the action proposed to be taken to offer for sale or to sell those assets.
