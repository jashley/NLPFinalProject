according to mr gould's submission, it is no answer to say that he was able before the tribunal to supplement the evidence he had given before the board.
section 1317b(1) of the law (and of the act) provided that application might be made to the tribunal for review of, relevantly, a decision made under the law (or the act) by the board.
the existence of questions of law goes to the court's jurisdiction.
