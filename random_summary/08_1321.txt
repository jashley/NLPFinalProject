(revised from the transcript) 1 this is an appeal from a decision of the federal magistrates court refusing to grant constitutional writ relief to the appellant in respect of a decision of the refugee review tribunal which affirmed the decision of a delegate of the minister not to grant the appellant a protection visa: szlsw v minister of immigration [2008] fmca 498.
when it became clear to the tribunal, having listened to the tape of the delegate's interview, that its impression was wrong about that apparent discrepancy, the tribunal accepted that there was some consistency between the two accounts, although there were other significant differences to which it pointed.
no significant time or expense is involved.
