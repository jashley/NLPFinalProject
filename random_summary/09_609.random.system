by far the majority of the hearing both in terms of actual hearing time and preparation for the hearing was taken up in the applicant's pursuit of wide ranging discovery which i described as fishing.
i certify that the preceding eight (8) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice mckerracher.
i have accepted the assurance given by senior counsel for the respondents which was that if formalisation of discovery was all that had been sought, it would have been provided promptly.
