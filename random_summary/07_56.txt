the proceedings in which this motion arises were commenced on 16 november 2006 when the applicant, olivaylle pty ltd, filed and served an application and statement of claim against the respondent, flottweg gmbh &amp; co kgaa, seeking damages for breach of contract and relief under ss 82 and 87 of the trade practices act in respect of an alleged contravention of s 52 of the trade practices act 1974 (cth).
from answers given by counsel for flottweg at the hearing before me, this occurred at olivaylle's place of business.
the evidence before me suggests that olivaylle would appear to have a substantial olive growing and processing business conducted on a near 2,000 acre property which has been visited by representatives of the respondent in the circumstances i noted earlier.
