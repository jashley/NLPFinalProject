the material in support of the application does not disclose a sufficient basis to understand how it could be relevant to the present appeal given that --- (i) there has been no application to set aside the orders of federal magistrate barnes, (ii) in the present matter federal magistrate driver took into account mr donnelly's file note, (iii) no submission has been made suggesting that a different outcome could or should have been reached if evidence had been called from mr donnelly, (iv) mr donnelly's affidavit does not indicate on its face why such a different outcome might be reached, and (v) there has been no explanation of why mr donnelly's affidavit could not have been put before federal magistrate driver.
insofar as the motion to vacate the hearing date relies on the foreshadowed application to seek leave to call evidence from mr donnelly, i am satisfied that no such indulgence should be granted.
given the lack of information in these affidavits and the fact that mr and mrs murray were not present in court (and apparently reside in tamworth), i requested that mr mckell attend court.
