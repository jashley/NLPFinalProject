39 i find that neither security guards nor police officers were involved in mr rana's departure from the convention centre.
he states, and i accept, that the email messages referred to in 1 and 2 above were not sent from the university's email system, that they appear to have been sent from an email address which he identified and which suggests a link with mr rana, and that the face of the email message has been altered at the time of sending to make it appear that it originated from the university.
in light of the evidence which i have accepted, i find on the balance of probabilities that mr rana sent the three email messages referred to above.
