4 before the federal magistrates court, the appellant claimed that the tribunal acted in bad faith and/or was biased, had failed to investigate the appellant's claims, had denied the appellant natural justice and had made factual findings that were wrong.
5 the federal magistrate found the appellant's claims could not be sustained because there was no evidence of bad faith or actual bias on the part of the tribunal nor was there anything on the face of the decision which gave rise to an apprehension of bias.
the federal magistrate further found in any event that there was nothing on the face of the tribunal's decision to suggest an illogicality nor lack of foundation to its findings, and that there was nothing to enliven an obligation on the part of the tribunal to give particulars pursuant to s 424a(1) of the migration act 1958 (cth) ("the act ") having regard to the principles established in saap v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] hca 24.
