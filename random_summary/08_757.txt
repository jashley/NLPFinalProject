i do not accept dr weidmann's approach to the question of when the impairment became permanent.
section 24(2)(b) of the 1988 act requires, for the purpose of determining whether an impairment is permanent, regard to be had to the likelihood of an improvement.
the tribunal concluded: ...the decision as to when such a condition and the resultant impairment has become permanent is for the determining authority to decide on the basis of all the available evidentiary material.
