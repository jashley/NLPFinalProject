it follows that the applicants did not file substituted statements of claim because the respondents caused them to, but rather because the new jurisdiction required it.
at the hearing on 3 february 2006 only [4]-[5] of the motion remained, that is, the portion seeking security for costs but only in respect of the first applicant.
it is submitted that no order was made on the hearing of the notice of motion on 8 february 2006 as between the first applicant and the third and fourth respondents, presumably because the court intended that those costs would follow the hearing of the remaining part of the notice of motion, that is, the security for costs application.
