in my opinion, there having been a plain jurisdictional error, it is not appropriate to refuse the appellant relief in all the circumstances.
had he not been pursuing, as a member of the class, on legal advice, two actions which it is not suggested could not have afforded him relief, then there would obviously be no reason to ignore the period between february 1998 and february 2004 while those actions proceeded.
in my view, it clearly challenged a fundamental premise of the reasoning of the tribunal, namely that it regarded the appellant as being a discreet person and that his likely treatment and fear of persecution were he to return to malaysia had to be assessed on that basis.
