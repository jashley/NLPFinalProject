it appears to be comprehensive and candid.
i am not sure that it is appropriate to determine that an appropriate break fee may be fixed by reference to a percentage of the equity value of the takeover target as distinct from a genuine pre-estimate of the costs of the proposed offer.
that obligation arises only if the other party to the proposed arrangement, that is broadcast australia, has a prescribed shareholding in the target company, or that any director of broadcast australia is a director of hostworks.
