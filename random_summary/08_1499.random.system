1 in gryst v dromana [2008] fca 1148 i ordered that an application under s 459p of the corporations act 2001 (cth) to wind up dromana be summarily dismissed under s 31a(2) of the federal court of australia act 1975 (cth).
9 accordingly, i will order that mr gryst pay dromana its costs on a party and party basis up to and including 16 july 2008 and thereafter on a solicitor and client basis.
the reason for that, as i indicated in my reasons, was that in the circumstances mr gryst could not avail of a presumption of insolvency under s 459c(2)(a) as the statutory demand was stale and there was no other basis relied upon to wind up dromana.
