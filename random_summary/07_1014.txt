8 while there is provision in s 494(3)(b) for the commission to extend the time for lodgement, there is no provision for the commission to remedy a failure to comply with s 494(3) , insofar as that provision requires that the declaration be made before the date on which notices of the meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed are sent out.
the effect of s 494(3) is simply to provide that, unless those prerequisites are satisfied, a purported declaration of solvency has no effect for the purposes of the act.
there is no requirement for a declaration of solvency to be made before the date on which notices of a proposed meeting of members are sent, or for a declaration of insolvency to be lodged before that date.
