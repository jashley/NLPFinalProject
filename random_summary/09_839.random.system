i was of opinion that, having regard to the material before me and the objects of the act, it was appropriate to order that particular portions of the evidence revealing commercially sensitive material dealing with, among other matters, individual competitor's internal costs, prices and sales information be kept confidential so as to protect the interests of persons who provided the ceo and the minister with information in these matters, and also to ensure that, in the future, others will co-operate in similar exercises.
she deposed to the importance of protecting that confidence so that persons are not put in a position where the court might force disclosure of their commercially sensitive information to their competitors.
i gave oral reasons, ex tempore, largely to the effect above as my reasons for making the confidentiality orders at the hearing.
