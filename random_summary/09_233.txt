section 424a(3)(b) excludes from the information that must be supplied by the tribunal to the applicant, information that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application for review.
specifically, the tribunal found that if the applicant returned to china there was no real chance that he would be "arrested, detained, tortured, imprisoned or killed for writing anonymous letters of complaint to the authorities or for his membership of, or perceived membership of, and activities associated with the freedom and democracy party".
