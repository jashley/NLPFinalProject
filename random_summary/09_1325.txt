p.62 (p.5 of document) r3 irrelevant document 6.1 page number type of claim irrelevant --- not within justice finkelstein's 4 august order?
i have considered the masked sections of the discovered documents and approached the issue whether the claim for legal professional privilege should be upheld on the basis of the authorities and principles referred to by senior counsel for the fourth defendant and the cross claimants.
i accept that in order to justify a claim for protection from production of documents on the ground of legal professional privilege a party has to do more than simply utter the litany "legal professional privilege".
