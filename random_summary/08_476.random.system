accc submitted that an injunction was necessary, having regard to prouds' conduct to date and the evidence of mr cockayne concerning its practices.
the notion that the promoted "was" price would be taken by consumers to be reference those prices was at the forefront of accc's submissions.
it is sufficient to note that, in my opinion, the precondition contemplated in the draft order is not likely to exhaust the ways in which dual pricing can be undertaken without engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct.
