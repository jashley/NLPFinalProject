section 18 confers a right to intervene and is a right which should be construed and applied in the statutory context in which it appears and in a manner which promotes the objects and purposes of the 1977 act.
such a right or entitlement is consistent with the language employed in both those cases dealing with the intervention of an attorney general in private litigation and the language employed when considering such comparable provisions as s 78a of the judiciary act .
