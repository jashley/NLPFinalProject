however, it seems to me that the interests of justice require an opportunity to be afforded to the plaintiff, which apparently advanced $500,000 to the defendant company at a time when it is said that the company was insolvent, to consider its position and, to use the expression of counsel for the plaintiff, "re-group".
26 the applicant's explanation for it's decision to commence a new proceeding, rather than to seek leave to introduce its s 52 claims in the victorian proceeding, has left me quite unconvinced.
the victorian proceeding had the object of recovering compensation against the directors pursuant to s 588m(3) of that act which the plaintiff quantified at $643,836, being the $500,000 which was lent and not repaid, plus interest.
