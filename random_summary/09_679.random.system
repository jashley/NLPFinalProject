a determination of native title in aboriginal people by orders of the federal court in the exercise of power conferred by the native title act , is the expression, consistent with the scheme of the act, of what the chief justice of australia, chief justice french, has described as the "beneficial purpose" of the legislation to provide for the recognition and protection of native title, as set out in s 3 of the act.
section 87 as it applies to this application provides that if after 9 december 2003 the parties reach agreement on the terms of a proposed consent order in resolution of the proceeding (the agreement being filed in the court) and the court is satisfied that such orders are within power, the court may make orders in or consistent with those terms, if it appears to the court to be appropriate to do so.
for these reasons, it is important to say something about the source, origin and nature of the rights of the kuuku ya'u people; the application which is today resolved by this determination; and, the agreement reached by the parties which has led to the proposed consent orders.
