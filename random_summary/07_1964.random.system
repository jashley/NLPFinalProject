2 the proceedings as presently constituted were the subject of a consolidated application filed 2 july 2007 and a consolidated statement of claim filed 2 july 2007.
the conduct there complained of was conduct by a mr smith, who made direct approaches to officers of one of the applicants over a period of time on 8 and 9 august 2002 which his honour described as the sending of a series of threatening sms messages.
in that judgment (at 474) his honour identified three categories of contempt, one of which was contempt in 'abusing parties who are concerned in causes'.
