4 order 82 r 7 of the federal court rules provides as follows: in deciding whether to transfer a proceeding or an appeal to the federal magistrates court, factors that the court or a judge may take into account, in addition to the factors to which the court or the judge is required to have regard under subsection 32ab (6) of the act or subsection 44aa (7) of the tribunal act, include: (a) whether the proceeding or appeal is likely to involve questions of general importance, such that it would be desirable for there to be a decision of the federal court on one or more of the points in issue; (b) whether, if the proceeding or appeal is transferred, it is, in the opinion of the court or the judge, likely to be heard and determined at less cost and more convenience to the parties than if the proceeding or appeal is not transferred; (c) whether the proceeding or appeal is, in the opinion of the court or the judge, likely to be heard and determined earlier in the federal magistrates court; (d) the wishes of the parties.
