indeed, there is every reason for them to do so.
2 as i indicated when i made orders convening the meeting, i had scrutinised (without the benefit of a contradictor) the arrangement to ensure, so far as i could detect, that there was nothing on the face of it which might lead to a refusal of approval if the meeting assented to the transaction.
i saw no such barrier and none has been pointed out to me since.
