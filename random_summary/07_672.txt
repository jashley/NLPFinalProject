8 the terms of the order of 16 september 2005 were as follows: "the defendant appear before [specified officers of the commission] at 9 am on 28 september 2005 at [the commission's] sydney office, for examination on oath, and provide [the commission] all reasonable assistance with its investigation, pursuant to a requirement made under s 19(2) of [the asic act] .
notwithstanding that, in my reasons of 20 december 2006, i concluded that the defendant should be found guilty of a charge of contempt for failing to provide all reasonable assistance to the commission at a hearing on 3 february 2006, i do not consider, on reflection, that the defendant should be punished separately for any failure to provide reasonable assistance on that occasion.
the commission commenced the investigation on 15 april 2005 and subsequently decided to examine the defendant on oath pursuant to s 19 of the asic act.
