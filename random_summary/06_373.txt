the tribunal's discussion and reasons in more detail for its conclusion upon the first issue arising as to whether there was a ' marital relationship ' for the purposes of ss 8a and 8b of the superannuation act 14 the tribunal considered that ' the real question is not whether the ultimate relationship of the [appellant] and the deceased member was a "marital relationship" at common law, but rather whether it was a "marital relationship" for the purposes of ss 8a and 8b ' of the superannuation act , which the tribunal described ' as a materially different issue '.
40 the fallacy of the appellant's approach to construction of the statutory language actually employed, and so employed in the sequence of use appearing, was exemplified by the appellant's submission to the court, in the course of final address, as follows: '... the proper starting point to ask is simply whether the person --- in this case the appellant --- had been living with the other person, her husband --- and there is no dispute that they remained married at the time --- as that other person's husband or wife for a continuous period of at least 3 years... the tribunal failed to do that.
