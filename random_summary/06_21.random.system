33 paragraph [338] of the majority's judgment in the full court deals with the conclusion that safeway, in four instances, contravened s 46(1)(c).
" 8 it was the unanimous view of the full court that in relation to the preston market incident i had erred in not finding that safeway and tip top made an arrangement that contained a provision having the purpose or likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market in contravention of s 45(2)(a)(ii) of the act .
" 44 although the retail bread market in victoria was highly competitive at the time of the contravening conduct and it continued to be so notwithstanding safeway's conduct, there was an anti-competitive consequence in each of the four s 46 incidents which resulted from misuse of safeway's market power.
