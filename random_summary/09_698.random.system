by consent of the parties, the observations made by mr demarte have been received by the court.
in my view, the conduct of blaze, through mr mchenry, in not personally lodging the sbs on friday afternoon of 5 june 2009 at the perth offices of asic, has been fully explained.
it seems that up to 4 june 2009, there had been a partial 5.14% acceptance of the takeover offer (as explained in exhibit am2 to the affidavit of mr mchenry at p 13).
