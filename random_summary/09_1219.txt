mr kerr has appearances in the brisbane magistrates court in october for directions in relation to a number of matters concerning personal debts arising from the financial stress experienced by the family.
ms kerr is appealing the decision of the district court to the court of appeal of queensland, although in his affidavit mr kerr deposed that the other party had applied for ms kerr's appeal to be summarily dismissed.
accordingly, while i am prepared to adjourn the hearing, it is only with a view to permitting ms kerr extra time to prepare her case before his honour, and in circumstances where a hearing date is set in early 2010.
