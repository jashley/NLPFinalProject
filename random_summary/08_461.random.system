the shareholders agreement, relevantly, provided as follows: "5.1 it is acknowledged and agreed between the shareholders that: (a) a person desiring to transfer any shares in the company shall give a transfer notice to the directors and the directors and the proposing transferor shall proceed to establish the fair value of the shares within 28 days after the transfer notice is given; (b) ... (c) if the proposing transferor does not withdraw its transfer notice the directors shall proceed to offer the shares to the other shareholders in the same proportion, as nearly as the circumstances admit, as the shares held by them at the time of the offer bear to the total number of shares held by all shareholders, excluding the shares held by the proposing transferor; (d) ... (e) ... (f) ... (g) if the whole of the shares desired to be transferred have not been transferred within 90 days from the date of the offer made pursuant to clause 5.1(c), the proposing transferor may sell the shares for a price not less than the fair value to any person, but the directors may refuse to register the transfer on the grounds that either: (i) they are not satisfied that the transaction is a bona fide sale at a price not less than the fair value; or (ii) the proposing transferee is a competitor of the company.
a member who desires to transfer a share will carry his intention into effect by executing a transfer and lodging it for registration.
in our view this will be a transfer of shares for the purposes of clause 5.1 of the shareholders' agreement relating to prixcar.
