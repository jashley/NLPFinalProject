such examples were recognised by o 55 of the 1875 rules which, after stating that costs shall be in the discretion of the court, declared that "nothing herein contained shall deprive a trustee, mortgagee, or other person of any right to costs out of a particular estate or fund to which he would be entitled according to the rules hitherto acted upon in courts of equity"], there are very few, if any, exceptions to the usual order as to costs outside the area of disentitling conduct.
the applicant's submission is based on my finding that the respondents failed in the defence of the infringement allegation, and failed on all grounds of invalidity which they asserted, except for lack of novelty.
in my judgment, the usual order as to costs should be made in this case.
