15 the issue to be resolved is whether in these circumstances legal professional privilege can subsist over the documents.
i also think that communications between mrs muir and her solicitors which relate to or pass on the discussions between her solicitors and mol are not privileged.
18 in my view the public interest that supports legal professional privilege must give way in respect of the documents in light of mr muir's ostensibly illegal conduct.
