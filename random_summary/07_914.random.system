(b) the declarations sought are similar to those which have been sought and contested by the respondent since the commencement of the proceedings.
in the case of candacal pty ltd (candacal) it was shown to have research and development expenditure of $2,398,074 in 1993/94 and to have contributed to the core technology expenditure the amount of $18,200,000 in that year (ie 10% of the core technology fee).
in my opinion the failure of the board to include the 1993/94 year in its registration of the syndicate was a slip and the board's decision was intended to cover that year.
