in written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant, it was taken as a given, rather than established by legal argument, that the power which mr trewin exercised under s 14t of the administration act was a personal discretionary one.
however, in his case in this court, the applicant did not attack so much of mr trewin's decision as arose under subs (1) of s 14t of the administration act .
where, as here, a discretion is conferred in very general terms, it is generally a matter for the decision-maker to decide what is relevant and what is not.
