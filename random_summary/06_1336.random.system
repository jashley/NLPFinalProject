heerey j dealt comprehensively with each issue raised by mr upton in the proceeding below and forcefully and convincingly rejected his claims.
there should be an award of indemnity costs.
8 mr upton contended that security for costs should not be ordered in his appeal because: &#8226; he is unable to provide security for $25 000 or any like sum because of the conduct of tasmanian perpetual trustees; &#8226; an order for security for costs and staying the appeal would stifle his appeal and lead to a sequestration order being made against him and to his other creditors being disadvantaged; and &#8226; tasmanian perpetual trustees did not request him to provide security for costs before applying to the court.
