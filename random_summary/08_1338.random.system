on the remitter, the tribunal, which i will refer to as the second tribunal, issued an invitation to appear to the appellant and the appellant attended at the hearing and gave evidence.
it is not necessary (and often would be inappropriate) for the tribunal to put to an applicant, in so many words, that he or she is lying, that he or she may not be accepted as a witness of truth, or that he or she may be thought to be embellishing the account that is given of certain events.
the tribunal is not satisfied that these issues have any significance in accounting for lack of detail or for inconsistencies in evidence in the present case.
