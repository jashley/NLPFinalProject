he explained that his ground of appeal should be understood to allege that the tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction or constructively failed to exercise it by failing to have regard to a number of relevant considerations.
the tribunal could find no country information as to the muslim league having contact with 'pakistani underground agents', which the appellant claimed that they had.
the appellant identified these considerations as being: (a) the appellant's fear for his life if returned to india; (b) the attempt made to force him to undergo military training in pakistan; (c) the overall world situation since 1997 with particular reference to the emergence of al-qaeda; and (d) the harassment which he had experienced at the hands of some hindus and the police.
