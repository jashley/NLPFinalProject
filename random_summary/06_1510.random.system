in any event, the federal magistrate found, rightly in my opinion, that the tribunal had complied with s 424a in the manner in which the tribunal had written to the appellant.
it was put to him that the events about which he complained had occurred shortly after the insurgency had stopped and that there was now no real risk that he would suffer any harm if he were to return to the punjab.
it was his evidence that the appellant would be in danger if he were to return to india.
