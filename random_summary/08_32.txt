(e) in the event that either the first or second options are exercised by the lessee, the lessor and the lessee shall within 7 days after the date of the notice execute a contract to give effect to the sale in the form of contract for sale approved from time to time (" contract ") by the law society of south australia inc. which contract shall be prepared by the solicitors for the lessor and shall include terms to the following effect: a settlement shall take place on or before one calendar month from the execution of the contract.
the option to purchase in this case was exercised before the term referred to in the lease and it does not seem to me that the respondents' submission is a reason not to give effect to the conclusion i have reached.
there is no doubt that an option to purchase gives the optionee an equitable interest in the property.
