in my opinion, no case has been made out or asserted by ms luck which might reasonably lead a fair-minded lay observer to apprehend that i might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the questions that i will be called upon to decide as a member of the full court hearing ms luck's appeal in matter number vid 899 of 2008.
in the course of her submissions, on the application made ore tenus that i should disqualify myself, ms luck said words to the effect "i can understand why you wouldn't disqualify yourself," referring to me.
