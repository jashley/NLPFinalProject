when i made those orders, i indicated to the representatives of the parties who were present that the purpose of reserving liberty to apply was to enable anyone who took the view that i had made errors in the detail of the orders i made to inform me about those errors at the earliest possible time, preferably before the orders were entered, so that they could be corrected.
i certify that the preceding fifteen (15) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice gray.
nevertheless, i do not think it would be a proper thing for the court to make an order delaying that printing on the material available to me at the present time.
