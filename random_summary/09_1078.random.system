this order is supported by reason of some fairly brief submissions to the effect that the reason for the late amendment can be sheeted home to the applicant as a result of its resistance to the subpoena served on firstmac on or about 11 may 2009.
in addition, the applicant seeks indemnity costs on the basis of the circumstances which led to the late application to amend.
the applicant says that: (1) the respondents have been aware of their exposure to a claim for damages since february 2006 when they notified their insurers of the prospect of a claim; (2) these proceedings have been on foot since may 2008 and, the applicant has always claimed damages by reason of the respondents' alleged liability; (3) the respondents delayed taking any action in relation to the defence of the claim for damages, other than putting the applicant to proof by reason of the defence and it was not until may 2009 that the respondents took steps to issue the subpoena to firstmac limited, the lender, which has generated the need to seek leave to amend the defence; and (4) although it is the case that the applicant sought to have the subpoena set aside, it still took four weeks for the respondents to inspect and examine the documents produced under the subpoena on 23 july 2009.
