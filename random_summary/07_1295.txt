for those reasons, in my opinion, it would have been inappropriate to have allowed the appellant to argue those matters on this appeal.
7 on 18 november 2005 the tribunal sent a letter to the appellant at 36/460 pitt street, sydney, nsw, 2000 (the pitt street address), which was the postal address recorded on the appellant's initial protection visa application, seeking confirmation of the appellant's address and enclosing a change of contact details form.
18 there appear to be no "exceptional" circumstances in this case.
