49 there must be some doubt whether mr walsh has ever complied with the direction of 15 june 2006 to file a statement of claim.
however, if the document filed on 1 september 2006 is to be regarded as a statement of claim, as he insists it should be, then it is clearly liable to be struck out for non-conformity with the rules.
that, in any event, is not the task of the court even though he is unrepresented.
