on 29 november 2006 i heard a matter in another judge's docket which involved an appeal under the aat act, this time by comcare, raising an issue of construction of the definition of "disease" in s 4(1) of the src act which was contrary to that assumed to be, or else accepted by comcare as, correct in the earlier matter and on which i had relied.
3 it was only during the hearing of the latter matter that i became aware of the dictum of french and stone jj in comcare v canute [2005] fcafc 262 ; (2005) 148 fcr 232 at [63] - [66] with which, with respect, i agreed, but which nonetheless was inconsistent with the test that i had applied in wiegand .
i upheld the construction of the s 4(1) definition propounded by comcare, but dismissed the application on the basis that it would be futile to remit the matter having regard to the findings made by the tribunal: comcare v sahu-khan [2007] fca 15.
