however, i was not satisfied that mr malone's and mr rampe's evidence was a sufficient basis on which to conclude that the new information was so trivial that i could approve the scheme without further evidence as to possible consequences that the holding of that view by the sec may have for the implementation of the scheme.
mr malone then deposed that in his view the expression by the sec of the view referred to above, was "not a relevant consideration for [ukl] shareholders in determining whether or not to approve the merger with monaro".
members may have a view as to the risk posed by those three matters to the implementation of the scheme which in turn may influence their decision as to whether to continue to support the scheme.
