11 i am, therefore, content to make the orders which are set out in paras 1 to 6 of the amended notice of motion.
the amendments have been made as a consequence of comments that i made in my earlier reasons in respect of the apparent lack of evidence which would support a prima facie case against mr ford and mr bennett under s 75b of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) (the tpa), by reason of their involvement in the breaches of the first respondent.
however, it is not necessary for the party which suffers loss to have actually relied upon the impugned conduct.
