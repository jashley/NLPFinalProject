20 the tribunal accepted that the appellant had been arrested, detained and tortured in 1997 as he claimed.
52 the appellant also contended in ground 4 that the tribunal had not considered the appellant's claim that he would suffer persecution by reason of his imputed political opinion.
it found that it was not his fear of persecution that prevented him being involved in political activities but rather his lack of interest.
