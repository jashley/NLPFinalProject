the interest was paid into an account entitled "the amfc collections account".
in the course of a public examination of mr angeleri on 28 and 29 may 2009, conducted pursuant to part 5.9 of the act, he admitted that: section 598 of the act relevantly provides: "(2) subject to subsection (3), where, on application by an eligible applicant, the court is satisfied that: (a) a person is guilty of fraud, negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty in relation to a corporation; and (b) the corporation has suffered ... loss or damage as a result of the fraud, negligence, default, breach of trust or breach of duty; the court may make such order or orders as it thinks appropriate against or in relation to the person (including either or both of the orders specified in subsection (4)) and may so make an order against or in relation to a person even though the person may have committed an offence in respect of the matter to which the order relates.
it is not, however, necessary to make such a serious finding for present purposes.
