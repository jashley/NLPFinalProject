she is recorded as being a contingent creditor of brighton hall for the amount of $187,272, pursuant to a report which was prepared prior to the payment of the dividend from ann street mezzanine in liquidation.
in fact, if ms lawrence and other members of the group are successful in obtaining recovery under the policy of insurance, other unsecured creditors of brighton hall may benefit, as the total claims against brighton hall will be reduced by the amount paid out under the policy, and therefore, at least theoretically or potentially, increase the dividend payable to them.
i am also satisfied that there is at least a prima facie position that the other unsecured creditors of brighton hall will not suffer any prejudice by the grant of conditional leave.
