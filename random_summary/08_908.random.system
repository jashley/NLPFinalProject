on this last point, i note that there is a letter which was tendered as evidence before me at the hearing, confirming his attendance for appointments with a psychologist.
she refers to his present suffering from depression due to the ongoing stress, and says he is a "shattered man" with a lack of self-worth and sleeping difficulties.
she testifies to a long period of effective and commendable service by her husband.
