on 17 november 2004 he applied for a temporary business entry (class uc) visa on the basis that he was sponsored by an australian business, cs &amp; k transport pty ltd. on 18 january 2005 a delegate of the first respondent refused that application on the grounds that the sponsoring business nominated by the applicant was not approved as a business sponsor.
in those circumstances, i dismiss the application to set aside the order dismissing the appeal.
having heard the applicant and the respondent, i am firmly of that view.
