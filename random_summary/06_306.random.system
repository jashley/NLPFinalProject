quite a number were still at the function after four.
but, as the tribunal correctly observed, that case was concerned with quite a different situation, where the worker's injury was sustained in an "interlude or interval occurring within an overall period or episode of work" as distinct from "after the day's work has ceased" (see at 483 and the discussion by cooper j in gregory at 200-202).
there is no evidence to indicate that an announcement was made that the function had concluded.
