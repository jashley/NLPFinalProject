the corporations concerned are linked in ways i need not deal with at the moment.
if they are in collision then, in many cases, priority will be given to obtaining sensible information and advice from the administrators to enable the creditors to have the material before them to make an informed decision.
i have no doubt that in each case there is a strong case for extending the convening period.
