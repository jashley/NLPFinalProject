3 the primary judge found (amongst other things) that: - (i) the relevant class of consumer was purchasers of surfboards and surf related products, (ii) amongst this group mr fitzgerald is well known as is his association with hot buttered international pty limited, (iii) with reference to all of the evidence, the use of mr fitzgerald's name and image on the yellow 33 south t-shirt was conduct misrepresenting to a reasonable member of the relevant class that mr fitzgerald had some association with the production and sale of the t-shirt.
finally, insofar as the prospects of success can be assessed the respondents are correct in submitting that the appeal involves no question of principle but challenges a factual finding of the primary judge based on a detailed assessment of extensive evidence.
that consideration, it seems to me, is also reinforced by the judgment of gummow j in wiest v director of public prosecutions and anor [1988] fca 450 ; (1988) 23 fcr 472.
