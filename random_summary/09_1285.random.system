in reaching its conclusions the tribunal accepted publication of the articles on which the appellant relied but did not accept that the incident therein described occurred.
while the tribunal accepts that the newspaper articles appeared in the local karnal newspaper, the tribunal does not accept that the articles report on incidents that actually occurred.
there are other indications consistent with the inference that the tribunal did not have regard to the information from mr sharma relevant to the occurrence of the incident.
