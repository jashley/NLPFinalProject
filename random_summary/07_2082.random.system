accordingly, in my opinion, clough was obliged under cl 3.3.2 of the construction contract to extend the validity of the performance guarantees so that they would be valid for 12 months plus 60 days from the date of completion of works as varied.
injunctive and other relief would also be available under s 87(1a) of the tpa.
insurance cover was required amongst other things, for 'cargo trains' and 'contractors all risks' as well as 'third party' (cl 7.3.6).
