the tribunal accepted that the appellants were citizens of sri lanka.
it was contended that that was evidence of her involvement in politics.
the tribunal gave no weight to that involvement because of the appellant husband's evidence that not all unp supporters face harm in sri lanka and because the appellant husband consistently claimed that the harm he faced, and still faces, was specifically based on his work undertaken directly on behalf of unp politicians rather than merely his affiliation with the unp.
