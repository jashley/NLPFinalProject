although he was subsequently advised that his pay would be docked for the time that he spent at the day of protest i am satisfied that this has not occurred.
managers are to ensure that: &#8226; no leave (rec or flex) is approved for 15 november 2005 where it is known that an employee is attending the national rally; &#8226; other leave requests for that day (where it is not known if the employee is attending the national rally) are to be considered on the basis of operational requirements; &#8226; all employees wishing to access personal leave for 15 november are asked to provide a medical certificate or other suitable supporting evidence; &#8226; staff are advised that absences on 15 november without prior approval or, in the case of requests for personal leave, without supporting medical evidence will be treated as unauthorised and without pay; and &#8226; a record is kept by all managers of any staff member who fails refuses to attend work on 15 november 2005 in order to participate in the national community day of protest.
dotars cannot not pay you if you take authorised leave and attend the day of protest; and 5.
