in this particular case i am not persuaded that the circumstances of the case are such as to warrant a departure from the usual practice of the court in awarding party to party costs so far as the costs of the respondent are concerned.
an affidavit filed in court this morning by mr morgan gives evidence of the endeavours of the respondent to contact the applicant.
the categories of cases i have listed are not closed.
