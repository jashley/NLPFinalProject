i have been advised from the bar table that all of the members of the committee of creditors of central norseman gold corporation limited, who have been able to be contacted, also agree with the orders proposed.
it is for that reason that the plaintiffs now seek an order varying para 4.1.3 in each of the deeds, so that the words "for a period of up to 60 days" are replaced with the words "not later than 20 february 2007".
one of the matters is the ongoing discussions with representatives of one of the secured creditors, with a view to attempting to ensure that there will be a dividend paid to the general unsecured creditors of central norseman gold corporation limited.
