in the present case, it seems that the records of the respondent, at the relevant time, showed that the applicant had been an officer of austbloom, being a corporation which had been wound up, and in relation to which the liquidator had made such a report under s 533.
nothing presently said by the court would be at all relevant upon the hearing of such an appeal; neither would any observations now made with respect to those other grounds bear one way or the other upon the disposition of the present application.
the applicant did not institute such an appeal within time, but, on 4 august 2008, filed an application for an extension of time to do so.
