rather than relieving the project developer from the need to incur debt, as is usually the case in relation to an "equity" investment, the "risk fee", which was repayable on default and thereafter carried interest, had the potential significantly to aggravate the debt burden on the applicant.
in any event, there was no challenge to mr tilenni's evidence that a substantial component of the increase in the sum due is derived from a progressive increase in the amount of the risk fee, and also from interest being charged at the higher default rate.
