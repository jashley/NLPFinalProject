it was common ground (having regard to the pleadings) that a number of the contentious items in the love you mum catalogue were not offered for sale at the "was" price in the period immediately preceding the sale to which the catalogue was directed.
this was not true and each of the five items could have been bought in those three weeks at reduced prices significantly less than the "was" price.
the tickets did not use the word "was".
