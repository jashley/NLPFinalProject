no further evidence concerning this notebook was provided to the tribunal from either the applicant or her husband.
consequently the applicant was found not to be a credible witness and her evidence was rejected.
13 the absence of a response by her husband in my opinion was not 'information' but rather an observation and part of the reasoning process about the deficiency in the evidence before the tribunal: see wagp of 2002 v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural affairs [2002] fcafc 266 ; (2002) 124 fcr 276 at [26] - [29] .
