i consider it appropriate to fix costs because of the patent undesirability of continuing the litigation between the applicant and the third respondent.
as von doussa j said in beach petroleum at 123: "on the one hand the court must be astute to prevent prejudice to the respondents by overestimating the costs, and on the other hand must be astute not to cause an injustice to the successful party by an arbitrary 'fail safe' discount on the costs estimates submitted to the court..." his honour held, at 124, that the starting point for fixing costs must be the charges rendered by the applicant's solicitors, although in a complex bill there are likely to be items taxed off and there may well be occasions in which a judge will make a discount.
6 the third respondent is apparently a person of limited means and education.
