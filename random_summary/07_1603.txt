veda has invited mr dale and his legal representatives to propose any means (other than an applicant's consent) by which it may be lawful for them to disclose personal information contained in, for example, mr dale's credit information file to the other eight applicants and to the representatives of dr capital.
5 veda also seeks an order that upon the conclusion of the proceeding, the applicant's counsel and solicitors must destroy all copies of the said exhibits and any notes made or received in relation to the exhibits or any part of them.
however, there appears to be no evidence of a threat of such disclosure and in the absence of such evidence, an order would be inappropriate.
