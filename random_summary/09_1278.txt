on 2 november 2009 the solicitors for the minister forwarded a letter by express post to the appellant noting that the matter was listed for hearing on 5 november 2009 at 9.30 am and stating that if the appellant did not attend the hearing, either in person or by a legal representative, the solicitors for the minister were instructed to have the matter dismissed with costs.
second, and insofar as may be relevant, i have read the notice of appeal, the decision of the federal magistrates court and the first respondent's outline of submissions.
a telephone call to the minister's representative the day before the hearing asserting illness is an insufficient reason to justify the failure to attend today.
