31 in my view, the defendant has not adduced "evidence sufficient to raise doubt about the presumption" in terms of s 160(1) of the evidence act (or, a fortiori , "proved" the contrary of the deemed time of service provision of the acts interpretation act ).
17 section 142(1) of the corporations act provides that a company must have a registered office in the jurisdiction and that communications and notices to the company may be addressed to its registered office.
in any event, it is as well that i record that i am not satisfied on the evidence that the defendant has arranged finance.
