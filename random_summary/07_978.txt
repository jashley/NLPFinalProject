analysis i think it is quite clear that the bankrupt's possession of the property beyond completion of the contract was as a licensee of, and not as a tenant from, the applicants and that that situation did not change at any time before the date of bankruptcy.
all outgoings to be paid by the vendor from the date of settlement for the six month period the vendor is in occupation of the premises.
the background to the contract is that the property was used, in the course of the bankrupt's business, as storage for hundreds of car bodies and thousands of car parts.
