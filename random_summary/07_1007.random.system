11 the federal magistrate, in considering the tribunal's decision in light of the claims made by the appellant, found that the appellant "republished by reference and reliance, and otherwise adopted the statement given in support of the visa application in its entirety by the letter and statement of 6 march 2006; and, in the absence of any other statement, he 'gave' the information to the tribunal during the hearing by relying upon it as 'correct' ".
in the course of its reasons, the tribunal referred on a number of occasions to the statements made in the written statement accompanying the appellant's visa application, as well as to the evidence that the appellant gave before the tribunal.
16 in my view, the federal magistrate did not err in deciding that by submitting his post-hearing statement under cover of the letter of 6 march 2006, the appellant adopted and verified the information contained in the statement accompanying his visa application and that, accordingly, s 424a(3)(b) applied to the information in the first statement.
