on 23 january 2004 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the then department of immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs.
there is no factual finding by the federal magistrates court that mr meng was his agent when he completed the protection visa application.
whether evidence, argument or comment, as described by the appellant, would constitute "information" which would be capable of giving rise to the duty under s 424(1) does not in the circumstances arise.
