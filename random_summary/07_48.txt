i have taken into account the orders made on the motion, the hearing on 14 december 2006, the abandoned contention of improper purpose on the part of mr lock, and the extent to which mr viscariello succeeded on the contentions ultimately made on the hearing of his motion.
nevertheless, i think similar considerations arise where there is an examination ordered under s 596a and production ordered under s 596d.
i have no view on that matter.
