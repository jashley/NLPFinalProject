2 under s 25(2) of the federal court of australia act 1976 (cth) ('the act') an application for leave to appeal to the court may be heard and determined by a single judge or by a full court.
it is sufficient to say that i do not think there is a clear case for either the grant or refusal of leave.
22 i am not persuaded that there is any special need for expedition of either the application for leave to appeal or the appeal.
