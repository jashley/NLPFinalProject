implicit in mr rebikoff's case was the contention that because of the lack of "substantial injustice" to the applicant, supposing sundberg j to be wrong (see d&eacute;cor corporation pty ltd v dart industries inc [1991] fca 655 ; (1991) 33 fcr 397 at 398), there was no need to go to the other limb of the d&eacute;cor test and show that his honour's order was "attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being considered by the full court".
apart from anything else, victory in the australian proceeding may create some issue estoppel in favour of the applicant, or give it leverage in commercial negotiations.
however, he said, the applicant would in truth suffer no prejudice because, were sundberg j's orders to be reversed, the proceeding would continue in australia and not in the us and "the cost that they have to incur in prosecuting the proceeding in the united states would have to be incurred in australia in any event".
