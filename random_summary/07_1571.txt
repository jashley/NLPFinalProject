(first court hearing) introduction 1 the plaintiffs (i will refer to them respectively as "pga" and "pga tour") have applied for orders under ss 411 and 413 of the corporations act 2001 (cth) (the act).
however, this statement does not adequately reflect the position.
it should not go unremarked that if separate meetings were held, it would be possible, for example, for any of the 27 classes, with only, say, two members, to veto the proposal, even though all of the 1,446 full members of pga and all of the 157 full members of pga tour agreed to it.
