this factual issue was so relevant to those proceedings that it was unreasonable for the applicant not to have advanced the claim now made, as part of those previous proceedings.
one of the affidavits was sworn by the applicant on 20 march 1997, and the other was sworn by mr cacho on 3 april 1997.
in that amended application, the applicant relied upon s 30(1)(b) and s 306 of the act to seek a declaration that a 'proceeding' under the act had not been invalidated by a formal defect or irregularity.
