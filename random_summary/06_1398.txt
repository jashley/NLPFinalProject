at this stage, i am not persuaded that tracey j's approach to this issue was attended with any error.
he submitted that mr sharp's application was premature, and that whatever may have been said to sundberg j, in the course of an urgent application for interlocutory relief, should not be regarded as apra's actual position in the primary proceeding.
10 mr sharp's submission regarding the proper construction of s 65a , and particularly the term "damages" in s 65a(11) , seems to me to be without merit.
