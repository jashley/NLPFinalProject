it has been both at its interlocutory stages, and in the course of the trial to date, very closely contested indeed.
that, of course, means that when the solicitors for termicide have come to review, in accordance with their duties, the files of termicide, they have, assuming mr gabriel is to be accepted, if admitted in evidence, understandably enough taken the view that the document concerned was not amenable to discovery.
be this as it may, it seems to me that there is, in the interests of justice, a need for granitgard to be granted leave to re-open so far as an introduction of mr gabriel's evidence is concerned.
