the ' chorley exception' (from london scottish benefit society v chorley (1884) 13 qbd 872) is an exception - in the case of solicitors - to the general rule that successful litigants are not remunerated for the time spent in achieving success in the litigation.
particularly bearing in mind that the application for leave to appeal and appeal is imminent and as the chorley exception is the only basis raised for opposing costs, i consider that it would be appropriate to reserve the question of costs of and incidental to the application for determination by the full court on the application for leave to appeal and if leave is granted, on the appeal.
3 on the one hand there is the view expressed by parker j in the full court in dobree v hoffman (1996) 18 war 36 that the chorley exception does not apply.
