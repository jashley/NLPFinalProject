that seems to conflict with its pleaded defence, in which the allegation that, for example, telstra was not given notice of the material and analysis on which the commission based its allegations and statements in each of the consultation notice and competition notice, is denied.
where the pleadings raise an issue to be decided to which a party's documents may be relevant, the court will have discretion to order discovery ( treasurer of the commonwealth of australia v canwest global communications corp (unreported, beaumont, burchett &amp; emmett jj, june 1997)).
the notice of motion should be dismissed.
