the comments of matthews j in colonial portfolio services ltd v apra [1999] fca 1779 at [28] are applicable to the present scheme: it is relevant to note that apra, which operates as something of a watchdog in relation to transfers under part 9 of the act, had no objection to the confirmation of the scheme.
as indicated above i also considered the objections raised by individual policyholders, however i concluded that these objections do not outweigh the factors that support confirmation of the scheme.
their interests must be considered in the context identified in s 3(1).
