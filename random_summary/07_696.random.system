although the liquidator was aware of the accc's proceedings, the liquidator did not give notice to the accc of any intention to deregister dataline.
in the appeal, the accc seeks an order for a pecuniary penalty against dataline and also in respect of another respondent in the proceedings in liquidation.
on or about 24 november 2006, the accc's solicitors became aware that dataline had been deregistered.
