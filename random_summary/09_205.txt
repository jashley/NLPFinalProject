the amended application relevantly set forth this ground upon which review was sought as follows (without alteration): the tribunal did not give to the applicant before the hearing the information that it had about the political history and it did not give to the applicant the country information it had about bangladesh.
the applicant's brief oral submissions (via his interpreter), however, resolved this uncertainty --- he wished for all arguments to be now entertained and resolved.
