this is an unsatisfactory situation and has been brought about by the change of commercial course proposed to be taken by the plaintiffs.
i accept mr jones' submission that the reality of the present position is that the claim involving yrb is nowhere near the state of preparation of the proceedings in their present form and that he cannot responsibly say that the case will be ready to take a hearing date this year.
it is true that the matter will not get a hearing date this year, but i am of the view that the matter should be ready for hearing early next year.
