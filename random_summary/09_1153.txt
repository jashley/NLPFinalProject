i do not need to consider the effect of the terms of settlement and the principles in unity insurance pty ltd v rocco perzzano pty ltd [1998] hca 38 ; (1998) 192 clr 603.
had i known that the promissory note offering in fact constituted an interest in a managed investment scheme and that westpoint (or york street mezzanine) was seeking to raise promissory note funding without observing the provisions in the corporations law which pertained to managed investment scheme investments, and as such were liable to be wound up, i would not have approved of the york street promissory notes as appropriate investment products to recommend to clients of wealthcare.
i accept the submission of wealthcare, that it only has to be shown that pir's conduct or the falsity of the alleged representations was a cause of its loss: see eg i &amp; l securities pty ltd v htw valuers (brisbane) pty ltd [2002] hca 41 ; (2002) 210 clr 109 at [25] and [55] to [57]; henville v walker [2001] hca 52 ; (2001) 206 clr 459 , [13] and [14] per gleeson cj and king v yurisich (2006) 234 alr 425 at [90].
