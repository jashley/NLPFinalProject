i interpolate in passing that this 1992 tpd benefit decision of the trustee has not been challenged in this proceeding.
(5) my family &amp;i request that the proposed settlement has to include a resolution of my superannuation entitlements pursuant to mr j beer's letter dated 16-3-94 and rule c9(2)(a) of the fund.
i mention this in passing because, as will be seen, the trustee took out such insurance in respect of mr kowalski but allowed it to lapse.
