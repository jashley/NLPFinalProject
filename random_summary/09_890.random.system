polaris then identifies the three unsuitability representations: (a) soundshield is unsuitable for use in call centres because of its poor intelligibility where background noise is present; (b) soundshield does not comply with the telstra intelligibility requirement; and (c) soundshield is not suitable for tt4 compliant operation and is not g616 compliant.
the difficulty with polaris' case on this point is that it did not carry out a test of the two devices with speech input, and thus was unable to show whether there was "significant limiting" of soundshield, or more generally whether intelligibility in fact increased as a result of m15d's extra 7db.
so we are left with professor newell's default position (where the conditions are not satisfied) that a device set to 100 or 102dba will not result in significantly better speech intelligibility than one set at 95dba.
