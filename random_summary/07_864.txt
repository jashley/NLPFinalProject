16 figure 1 also shows that changes in the normal draft only slightly alter the area and shape of the hull at the water surface so that the width of the hull decreases in the area above the water line thereby restricting any additional lifting forces exerted against the hull by waves.
they also had low load stability and involved some engineering complexities, such as difficulty in installing and powering suitable water jet propulsion.
13 there are said to be five advantages which flow from the stena design.
