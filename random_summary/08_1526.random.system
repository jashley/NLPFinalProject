there is a line of authority in the federal court supporting the proposition that the mere refusal of a calderbank offer does not of itself warrant an order for indemnity costs and the offeror needs to show the conduct of the offeree was unreasonable.
discovery was given on 15 november 2007.
the respondent do pay the applicant's costs of the proceedings: (a) to be taxed on a party and party basis until 11 may 2007; and (b) thereafter the respondent do pay the applicant's costs of the proceedings to be taxed so as to include all costs and disbursements except insofar as they are of an unreasonable amount or have been unreasonably incurred so that subject to those exceptions, the applicant will be completely indemnified by the respondent for its costs after 11 may 2007.
