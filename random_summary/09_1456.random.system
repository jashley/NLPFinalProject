it seems that a company named horticultural operations ltd (hol) has played a leading role in the soliciting of the funds, but there is evidence that mr crouch has sought funds from the investor-debtors too.
by its interlocutory application, hpm seeks to restrain merilbah's liquidators from expending any part of this sum as well as from raising any further funds from "any member of the public".
