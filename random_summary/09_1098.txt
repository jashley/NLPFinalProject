nonetheless, having regard to the evidence that was before the tribunal and the tribunal's reasons for decision, the applicant submitted that it is clear that: (1) none of the '63 reports' (which at [168] the tribunal found created an adverse 'picture' that was 'true') were particularised or sufficiently particularised, nor was evidence led by the minister to prove that what was alleged against the applicant (which was entirely unclear) in fact occurred; (2) none of the allegations said to be 'sometimes facts' was identified or distinguished from the matters that were not 'facts'; (3) none of the conduct alleged was sought to be substantiated by evidence that went beyond mere general assertions.
however, where the decision-maker is not fully persuaded that the non-citizen has reformed, the discretion to refuse or cancel a visa is enlivened, and evidence of good acts and recent conduct becomes relevant to the exercise of the discretion (see part 2).
the applicant submitted that the tribunal should have disregarded the allegation that she was a 'major player' in the drug trade as well as the related imputation that drug activity had decreased since the applicant and her son had been detained.
