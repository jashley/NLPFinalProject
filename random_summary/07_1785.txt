i do not consider that mr fisher's own conduct has been demonstrated to be so unreasonable, or even that if the application against saxbys was obviously without merit, that a costs order against mr fisher would be appropriate.
18 i am prepared to do so in relation to the costs of and in connection with the hearings after the hearing on 11 july 2007 for the reasons given above.
those costs will be part of the orders i already propose to make in relation to the proceeding generally.
