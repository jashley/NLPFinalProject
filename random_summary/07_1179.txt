9 in the tws proceeding, i held that s 131aa(7) of the epbc act is a complete statement of the minister's obligation to provide procedural fairness in relation to his decision to approve, for the purposes of a controlling provision, the taking of an action and any conditions attaching to approval.
it must also be remembered that the minister's decision on approval only concerns matters that are the subject of the controlling provisions, as well as social and economic issues.
those matters include, under s 87(3)(c), an obligation to consider any relevant information received in response to an invitation to the appropriate state or territory minister to comment on whether the action is a controlled action and to give the minister "information relevant to deciding which approach would be appropriate to assess the relevant impacts of the action..." (see s 74(2)(b)(ii)).
