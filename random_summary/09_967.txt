on 4 september 2007, mr chesters spoke with an officer of the ato who said that urgent meetings were to take place within the ato concerning the request and any further public examination processes would need to be adjourned for a further two weeks within which time a decision would be made concerning the request for a further indemnity.
the request is for $170,000 which is in addition to the $30,000 that has already been paid.
section 556(1) treats those expenses as a claim of the liquidator upon the estate or property of the company.
