the tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the minister for immigration and citizenship who formed the view that the appellant is not a person to whom australia has protection obligations under the convention relating to the status of refugees 1951 , amended by the protocol relating to the status of refugees 1967 (convention) and accordingly refused to grant a protection visa on 23 june 2008.
in this case, the matter complained of by the appellant related to the tribunal's analysis of the evidence and the inconsistencies in that evidence - these were not matters which met the definition of "information" for the purposes of s 424a ( szbyr v minister for immigration &amp; citizenship [2007] hca 26 ; (2007) 235 alr 609) , and thus the tribunal was not required to make its letter of 11 november 2008 comply with the requirements of s 424a.
