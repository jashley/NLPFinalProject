the reasons for decision cover the preparation of revised mediation protocols and programs for those applications subject to mediation.
the directions hearings were otherwise adjourned to 29 june 2007.
where particular claims included in the 21 december 2006 judgment have been removed it is because they are not ready to mediate or because active mediation protocols are already in place.
