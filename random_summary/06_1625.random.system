grounds of appeal 6 by notice of appeal dated 4 may 2006, the appellant now appeals from the judgment of mcinnis fm to this court.
such an approach was adopted, for example, in mzwik v minister of immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2005] fca 185 and voaq v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs (2005) 224 alr 460.
in the circumstances of this case where there are no written submissions, and where it is not merely determining a point of law such as the competency of the court, i do not consider it is appropriate to proceed in that way.
