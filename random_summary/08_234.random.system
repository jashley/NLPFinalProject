the refugee review tribunal falied to see that the applicang satsfies all the crieterai that are required for a "refugee" status under the act and rules.
it is important to note that these inconsistencies were discussed with the applicant not only during the hearing, but they were also the subject of a letter addressed and sent to the applicant seeking his comment.
the tribunal has completely overlooked the seriousness of the matter.
