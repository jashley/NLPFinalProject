it differed from the 28 september 2007 notice in the following material respects: &#8226; only 3 construction sites were listed; &#8226; mr washington and mr mier were now also under investigation in respect of the alleged breaches of the wr act ; &#8226; mr mcloughlin was no longer subject to the investigation; &#8226; the suspected contraventions were particularised as set out at [12], [13], [16] and [17] above in respect of the events of 23 may 2007, 20 june 2007 and 6 september 2007 (twice).
it is alleged that mr setka made threats of violence to mr peterson and assaulted mr broadhead.
the same applies to a person who fails to answer questions relevant to the investigation while attending as required by the notice; see s 52(6)(v).
