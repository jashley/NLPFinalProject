further, two out of the four directors of medivac were diakyne nominees (mr ralph and mr radojev), with one (mr ralph) appointed the chairman.
given my conclusion that diakyne shares were not listed on a national stock exchange with the consequence that the first alternative pre-condition in the bonus provision was not satisfied, colorado must rely on the second alternative pre-condition - a trade sale of the diakyne business or its assets.
this evidence, i note, is inconsistent with the respondents' submission to the effect that no one at the relevant time, and until this proceeding, had communicated to mr ralph any problem with the payment of the bonus to colorado.
