the matter was called today and nobody has appeared to oppose.
i am satisfied by the evidence that there is both the capacity to meet the obligations which are being undertaken and willingness on the part of those involved to do so.
the evidence satisfies me that that meeting was duly convened taking into account the signed certificates which have been provided and the undertaking which has been proffered.
