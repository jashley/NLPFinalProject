in the performance of his duties, the applicant contracted serious physical and psychological illnesses which have impacted to a considerable extent on his and his wife's lives.
the matter was called on again this morning when the applicant appeared and made submissions why, in the circumstances of this appeal, costs should not follow the event.
the applicant, through no fault of his own, was not present on that occasion.
