again, leaving aside any issues of review processes, until such time as a decision is made, that position will continue as an authorised position?---it will continue as a position.
as noted, the 2005 agreement came into force on 19 july 2005.
having regard to the 2005 agreement as a whole (particularly the various references to "required", "established", "authorised" and "agreed and authorised" positions), against the background of rail reorganisation disclosed in cl 14 of the 2005 agreement, an "authorised position" should be understood as meaning a position which railcorp has agreed or intends or is otherwise bound to maintain at any of its establishments as a position.
