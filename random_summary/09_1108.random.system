first, while it was held in b that, on a plain reading of the relevant section of the qld act that purported to prevent a person refusing to answer a question on the grounds of privilege (s 190(2)(b)), it may be inferred that the intention of parliament was to abrogate all forms of privilege (except legal professional privilege), the dictionary meaning of the word 'privilege' in the qld act used the word 'means' (instead of 'includes') and specifically mentioned only two forms of privilege: self-incrimination and legal professional.
it should, perhaps, be noted that kiefel j had doubted the correctness of this decision: see the reasons of kiefel j at [15].
