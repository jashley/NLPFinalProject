the applications for leave to issue subpoenas to asic appear to rest on two bases set out in mr carey's affidavit of 15 august 2006.
the orders i propose to make are as follows: leave to the respondents to issue the subpoenas, drafts of which were filed in court, is refused.
the width of the proposed subpoenas suggests that the respondents are looking, in the material, for some basis for establishing their own solvency.
