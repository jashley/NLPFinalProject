the respondents object to this on the basis that the definition of "infringing articles" is too broad.
specifically in respect of the reference to "components" in proposed order 11(a) and (b), i reiterate my conclusion above that only the "infringing articles", and their component parts that have no reasonable use other than as component parts, fall within the definition of the term (and correspondingly should be delivered up for destruction).
20 i am satisfied that the balance of convenience in the application for a stay falls in favour of the respondents.
