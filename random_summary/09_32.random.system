having regard to these authorities i consider that the jurisdiction of the court has not been exhausted and that there is power to extend time and grant leave.
it is not unusual for courts to make such conditional orders which come into effect on the occurrence of a contingency.
nor am i persuaded that any injustice would be suffered if leave to appeal or an extension of time were not granted.
