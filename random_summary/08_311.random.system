i confess that one could understand a feeling of some grievance or disappointment by those concerned but the decision about bona fides in these matters --- and that is what this was essentially --- is one committed to the tribunal and the courts can only intervene in the event that there is a jurisdictional error made.
however, the tribunal did not accept that the harm was the result of their muslim religion or because of their support for the congress party or that the attack was by the shiv sena, or that the police had failed to respond.
it was said that the determination was one of fact reserved for the decision-maker that cannot be upset by judicial review and the ground was rejected.
