' i reject this submission because, on my finding, the russian federation, as the owner of the trade marks, would be entitled to have fkp account to it in respect of such fees and royalties and fgup, even if it had an earlier manifestation, was not an entity discrete and separate from the political state which created it, namely the ussr nor, at least until 18 april 2002, the relevant successor to that political state namely, the russian federation.
even aside from questions of power, a lack of evidentiary support and the inappropriateness of granting such orders against an entity outside the jurisdiction, the orders are inappropriate because of their sheer scope.
34 finally, such an order should be considered, if at all, only after inter partes discovery has taken place, based on appropriate evidence as to the likelihood of existence and provision of documents, and by reference to far more targeted and specific requests for documents, consistent with the authorities on such orders.
