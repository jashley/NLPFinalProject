please confirm that asic will provide a written statement under section 13 of the adjr act and that apra will not take any steps to release the transcript to apra until 7 days after receipt by me of the written statement.
21 the inclusion of s 13 in the ad(jr) act does not preclude the court from ordering discovery and inspection or any other interlocutory relief (see nestle at 265 and somerville at 48.
i should say, however, that it would not seem to me appropriate for the court to make an order that the respondent cause an affidavit to be provided which to all intents and purposes amounted to a s 13 statement in disguise.
