whilst the tribunal was able to assess the subsequent explanation from the nominator as to why the withdrawal document had been signed it should in my view following my reasoning in relation to the previous ground have permitted the applicant to adduce further evidence in support of the application which may have given greater corroboration to the likelihood or otherwise of the withdrawal having been made voluntarily.
it could then assess evidence from relevant departmental officers.
