i do not prejudge that at the moment, but that has not been alleged in terms.
with all respect, i fail to see any basis for discovery in relation to the failure to afford natural justice as alleged.
however, it seems to me that when i go through the individual paragraphs which are relied upon, there is no proper basis for discovery on this issue at this point because of two fundamental factors.
