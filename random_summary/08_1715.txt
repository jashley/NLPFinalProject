12 section 459h ca provides: 459h determination of application where there is a dispute or offsetting claim (1) this section applies where, on an application under section 459g , the court is satisfied of either or both of the following: (a) that there is a genuine dispute between the company and the respondent about the existence or amount of a debt to which the demand relates; (b) that the company has an offsetting claim.
where 'may' is used in subs (4), provides a discretion.
