the current appeal 10 before this court the appellant relies on five grounds of appeal.
only if a fair reading of the reasons allows the conclusion that the [tribunal] had a real doubt that its findings on material questions of fact were correct, might error be revealed by the [tribunal's] failure to take account of the possibility that the alleged events might have occurred (or the possibility that an event said not to have occurred did not in fact occur).
in many, if not most cases, determining what is likely to occur in the future will require findings as to what has occurred in the past because what has occurred in the past is likely to be the most reliable guide as to what will happen in the future.
