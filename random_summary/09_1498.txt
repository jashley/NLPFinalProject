such orders determine under the laws of australia that native title exists in the determination area according to the traditional laws and customs of the combined dulabed malanbarra yidinji people.
i am saddened that so many of the senior elders have died before seeing their native title recognised by australia and its laws.
i wish to acknowledge the contribution that those persons made to the transmission of the law and custom to the younger generations of dulabed and malanbarra yidinji people.
