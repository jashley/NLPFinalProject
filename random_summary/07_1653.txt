a psychological report for the appellant husband, along with statutory declarations from the appellants, were also provided to the tribunal.
the tribunal gave adequate and appropriate reasons for its decision in respect of those claims: minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v yusuf [2001] hca 30 ; (2001) 180 alr 1 at [68] .
its power to do so under s 424 of the act is discretionary and the tribunal did not have a duty to investigate the claims of the appellants.
