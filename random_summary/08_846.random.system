in my view, there is no convincing reason why the accc should have such a forensic advantage in a case in which, after all, it seeks to recover penalties against individual respondents for alleged contraventions of commonwealth law.
however, she cited accc v amcor , a decision of mine, in support of her contention.
among these was order 2, which required the respondent/contemnor to file any evidence in answer to the contempt motion by 15 may 2008.
