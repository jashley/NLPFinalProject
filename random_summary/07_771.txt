the grounds were that the tribunal failed to accord natural justice, identified the wrong issue and/or relied on irrelevant material and/or ignored relevant material, failed to exercise its jurisdiction under the act and/or acted in excess of its jurisdiction, and that the tribunal decision was made in bad faith.
the applicant failed to appear at the first listing date of 12 december 2006, and the federal magistrate dismissed the application for non-appearance.
his honour ordered that no further application fore review of the delegate's decision, or any decision of the tribunal in relation to that decision, be made without further order of that court.
