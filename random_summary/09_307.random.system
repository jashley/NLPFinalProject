however, even if an assumption is made that the statements at those pages of the transcript ought to be treated as, in effect, oral evidence, the statements do not answer the conclusion open on the totality of the evidence that authors of the bogdan plan used either the verona 245 plan, the cortona 245 plan or the cortona 290 plan (as the embodiment in final form of the features in those plans and the plan in suit) in bringing into existence the bogdan plan with its combination of features evident in the cortona 290 plan.
in this case, actual use is sought to be established as an inference arising out of contended striking similarities between the two plans.
that second matter becomes important in a case where there is no direct evidence of access to and use of the jennings' cortona 290 plan by the defendants and the plaintiff seeks to rely upon what is said to be significant or striking objective similarity between the cortona 290 and the defendants' plan, as giving rise to an inference that the defendants had access to and made use of the cortona 290 plan in bringing into existence their own plan and, further, that the defendants' plan is either a reproduction in a material form of the cortona 290 plan (s 31(1)(b)) or a reproduction of a substantial part of that plan for the purposes of s 14 of the copyright act .
