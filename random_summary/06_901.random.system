30 ms crowley did not submit a medical certificate in respect of her absence from 6 december 2004 to 6 january 2005 until 7 january 2005.
mr flint gave evidence that he terminated her employment for the following reasons: &#8226; her absence from work for an extended period during the previous 12 months; &#8226; her failure to give timely notification of her absences, in that medical certificates generally arrived in bundles and were backdated by several weeks and sometimes by a month; &#8226; the difficulty he experienced in communicating with her to ascertain when she would return to work; &#8226; his belief that there was little prospect of her returning to work in the short to medium term; and &#8226; his knowledge that she had applied for other jobs, including with tyco and attending interviews when she was supposed to be too ill to work.
