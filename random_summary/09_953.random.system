the tribunal concluded that it could not accept the medical certificate "as probative evidence that the applicant was attacked or injured due to his political or religious activities".
for all these reasons, the tribunal concluded that the applicant faced no real chance of persecution by reason of his activities in bangladesh and thus his contended fear of persecution by reason of his political activities and the practice of his religious beliefs did not give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution.
in the applicant's written submissions he puts it this way: ... the present tribunal did not put its effort to assess my persecution in my home country.
