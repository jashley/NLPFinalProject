the tribunal finds that the visa applicant did not enrol at itm until two years after he completed year 12 in 2000.
if, however, in using the word "actively", the tribunal meant merely to indicate that a visa applicant must in fact have been undertaking a full-time course as distinct from merely claiming to have done so, then there was no error.
after noting that there were two academic years (2000/2001 and 2001/2002) between the end of the visa applicant's "year 12" schooling and his attendance at the itm, the tribunal went on to say: the visa applicant claimed that his attendance at leang you chinese school and duon hoa chinese school, the english language training institute and the atlanta centre was for the purpose of improving his academic standing before he enrolled in post-secondary education at itm in 2002.
