mr killalea, who appeared as counsel for the appellant, contended that the letter of notification should have included a statement to the following effect: if this letter is sent to you (i) by prepaid post; and (ii) it was sent to your last address for service provided to the minister, or was sent to your last residential or business address provided to the minister; being an address in australia; and (iii) this letter was dispatched from the department of immigration, in australia, within 3 days of its date, then you are taken to have received it 7 days after the date of the letter.
