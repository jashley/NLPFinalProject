ms kerr proposes to commence proceedings in the federal magistrates court in the near future.
there is authority that the discretion in respect of ordering or refusing an adjournment miscarries where the refusal of an adjournment results in one of the parties being unable adequately to present his case ( thornberry v r (1995) 69 aljr 777).
notwithstanding that i propose to adopt this approach in favour of ms kerr, in my view it is also reasonable that the appeal be heard within a reasonable time frame.
