it seems to me that it gives recognition to the indications and to principle to allow some additional amount then per unit in respect of costs, other than labour costs, associated with the sale of the counterfeit irons.
the case in respect of which default judgment was entered, as it emerged from the statement of claim, was this: (a) from about early 2007, the respondents carried on a business of selling hairstyling products via the internet.
having said that, and without descending to the detail, the overall amounts do seem to me to be rather large, both in respect of solicitor's costs and counsel's fees.
