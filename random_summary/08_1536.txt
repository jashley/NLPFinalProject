there was further argument as to whether, if a retiree's interest falls within the s 42(2)(e) or s 40(3)(d) exception and is therefore deemed to be subject to perpetual's mortgage, the court must in any event then compare the interests of the parties as competing equities.
i respectfully agree with his conclusion on this point.
