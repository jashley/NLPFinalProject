i accept that ms edwards told mr blaikie that 'everything was great' but he acknowledged during cross-examination that he sought no verification of her advice.
37 i do not consider it necessary to determine whether the terms of the personal insolvency agreement executed by mr blaikie 'are unreasonable or are not calculated to benefit the creditors generally' within the meaning of s 222(1)(d).
it seems that ms edwards resigned her employment with the advantage group in june or july 2002 but continued to work for a further month.
