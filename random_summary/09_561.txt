it follows from my conclusions above that it is unnecessary to consider whether or not mr priestley is a person aggrieved or whether or not s 23 of the federal court act is a source of additional jurisdiction.
i am prepared to assume for the purposes of this notice of motion that, had the claimed decision been made, mr priestley would have been a person aggrieved.
to the extent that mr priestley makes this contention, there is no evidence to support it.
