2 the native title act 1993 (cth) ('the nta') does not contain an express authorisation to make an order that the registrar enter details of the claim to take effect from an earlier date where the court reviews the registrar's (or the delegate's) decision not to accept a claim for registration under s 190d.
in any event the question here is one of construction of the nta, having regard to its purposes and intended operation.
section 186(1)(ca) requires the date upon which the claim is entered on the register to be included in it.
