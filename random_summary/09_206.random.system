mr david brown states that the descendants of mr jack brown (a person said to form part of the brown family group in both the application and amended application), namely, ms hazel brown, mr ricky brown and ms martha edwards, are part of the am-y claim group (see para 1.6 above).
she states (among other things) that ms nellie brown has been excluded "as one of her granddaughters, ms maureen williams, was on the am-y governing committee and did not want to be part of the brown family group".
first, none of messrs david brown, bobby and sammy brown and sandy brian buzzacott were given notice of the meeting and none of them authorise the applicant to make the application or deal with matters arising in relation to it.
