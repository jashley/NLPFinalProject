47 mr strahley said that shortly after the 17 december 2004 meeting, he had a telephone conversation with mr tracy in which mr tracy told him that he was looking for someone to obtain a crop status report to ascertain yields and condition of the crop.
the likely explanation of this recollection is that it is consistent with mr strahley's version of events, namely that picking of lemons could begin in january 2005, and that lemons picked early could, if grade 1 lemons, achieve prices of $70 per carton.
there was just a slow --- well, a --- an obvious lack of management throughout the orchard.
