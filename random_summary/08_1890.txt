8 among the documents in the tribunal's possession at the hearing, were documents which comprised the student visa application made to the department by the appellant's third daughter.
the tribunal also failed to consider independent country information that supported the appellant's claim.
further, as to the ground of appeal based on the third ground of review, in my view, for the reasons which he gave, the federal magistrate did not err.
