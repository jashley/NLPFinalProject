there is, as i have said on previous occasions, no precise formula in determining what is an appropriate level of security, nor the identification of the stages of the litigation in respect of which security should be provided, if it is to be provided on a staged basis at all.
the respondents, if successful, could find themselves with a costs order in their favour which they are unable to enforce.
the highest it seems to be put in his solicitor's affidavit is that the provision of the security would impose significant additional costs upon the applicant and place significant restrictions upon his personal financial freedom and planning.
