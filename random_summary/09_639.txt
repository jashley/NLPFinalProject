in the circumstances before me i am not prepared to set aside the subpoena served on ms chaloner.
ms kaye chaloner, a witness who has been subpoenaed by the respondents in these proceedings, yesterday filed a notice of motion moving for the following orders: in support of the notice of motion ms chaloner filed an affidavit (sworn 10 june 2009) in which she deposed in summary: a copy of a medical certificate in which a medical practitioner certified that she would be unfit to testify on 10 and 11 june 2009 inclusive, and a copy of her letter to the respondents' solicitors, are attached to her affidavit.
mr troy thomas has deposed, inter alia , that although he did visit ms chaloner on 5 june 2009 as a friend, he never said that he would not enforce the subpoena or that she was not required to give evidence.
