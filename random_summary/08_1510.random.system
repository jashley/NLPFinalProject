it is alleged that they were forced to pay higher prices for these products because of a global cartel arrangement to which the foreign respondents were party together with other manufacturers and suppliers of rubber chemicals.
in paragraph 19(b), for example, it is alleged that each of the foreign respondents: "imposed on its respective australian respondent additional operational procedures and restrictions by which the foreign respondent could require the australian respondent to act consistently with the global cartel arrangement or the periodic cartel arrangements as in place from time to time.
no material facts are pleaded to identify the "additional operational procedures and restrictions" which were said to have been imposed on australian subsidiaries or to identify the means by which and the terms in which they were said to have been imposed.
