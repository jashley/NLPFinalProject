in particular: &#8226; notwithstanding the formal offer by the tribunal to test the application again, the applicant provides no explanation to this court as to how or why, as a result of amendments to the act , it is possible that the tribunal may view the claim as authorised whereas previously it had not &#8226; no additional evidence was produced by the kabi kabi #3 applicant to the court in response to the notice of motion to have the kabi kabi #3 application struck out demonstrating that the kabi kabi #3 application was in fact authorised &#8226; the written submissions of qsnts in relation to flaws in the alleged authorisation process in kabi kabi #3 have not been addressed by the kabi kabi #3 applicant &#8226; i fail to understand how extra time allowed to the kabi kabi #3 applicant in these circumstances will address a key issue raised by mr rangiah, namely that there are currently two applications allegedly authorised by kabi kabi people, covering a very similar area of land and involving eleven common apical ancestors, however both applications cannot be authorised, and either one or both of the applications must not be authorised in accordance with s 61(1) of the act .
however in the affidavits accompanying the application there was in fact little evidence or detail as to the authorisation process, for example: o there is no identification of the elders who attended the meetings and whether such elders were present at each meeting, for example, the elders present at the 16 december 2005 meeting are not named or otherwise identified o there is no indication of how the persons referred to as elders were identified as being elders o there is no indication of what family each of the elders represented and what representation or consultation was accorded to families who did not have elders attending o there is no indication of who the "other persons" who gave the authorisation at the meeting on 16 december 2005 were, who authorised them to represent and speak for the descendants o there is no evidence of the basis upon which the elders were identified and why elders who were not present were not required to be consulted o at para 5(g) of each of the affidavits filed in support of the kabi kabi #3 application on 7 april 2006 by the 12 persons constituting the kabi kabi #3 applicant, the deponents depose that the elders confirmed that they had consulted with and had the authority to make this decision from "the members of their respective families".
