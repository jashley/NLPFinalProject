the real issue is not what is considered to be in the public interest or whether public interest considerations are a recognised exception to the usual rule, but rather, whether it can be said that there are sufficient public interest related reasons connected with or leading up to the litigation that warrant a departure from or outweigh the important consideration that a wholly successful respondent would ordinarily be awarded its costs.
19 the breadth of the discretion to award costs against a successful defendant is explored in the case of oshlack where gaudron and gummow jj (kirby j agreeing) held at 91 that the trial judge's discretion to award costs under s 69(2) of the land and environment court act 1979 (nsw) had not miscarried when he took into consideration the "special circumstances" of the case including the motivation of the litigant, the public interest and notoriety generated by the case, and the difficult points of law raised by the case.
in particular, tws submits that the public interest nature of the proceedings is a recognised basis for departing from the usual order as to costs: see, ruddock per black cj and french j at 236 who said that despite the difficulties associated with the broad meaning of the 'public interest': the term may best be seen as an envelope or class description for a range of circumstances which, upon examination, may be found to be relevant to the question whether there should be a departure from the ordinary rule that costs follow the event.
