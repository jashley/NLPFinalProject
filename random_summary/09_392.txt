relevant legislation section 347(1) of the migration act provides, so far as relevant to the present case: an application for review of an mrt-reviewable decision must: (a) be made in the approved form; and (b) be given to the tribunal within the prescribed period...and (c) be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any).
having taken steps to advise the appellant that his application for waiver of the fee normally required in conjunction with an application for review had been refused, the tribunal proceeded to dismiss the application for review on the basis that it had no jurisdiction.
see especially [50]-[52] in the reasons for judgment of the full court.
