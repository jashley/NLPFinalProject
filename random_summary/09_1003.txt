there is nothing in the draft notice of appeal which would suggest that his honour in any way erred in the exercise of his discretion in relation to his refusal to grant mr nicholls an adjournment.
he claims that during the period between the delivery of justice mansfield's reasons on 23 july 2009 and 13 august 2009, which would have been the last day for the filing of a notice of appeal in compliance with o 52 r 15(1), he had to spend all of his time in preparation for an appeal to the full court.
for the reasons which follow, i do not think, in the context of this proceeding and having regard to the history of this proceeding, it is a special reason.
