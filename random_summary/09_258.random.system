.
upon making the disclosure, counsel for lanepoint informed me that he had already discussed that matter with mr carey although it was not then asserted as a ground for my recusal in this case.
i have concluded that, even were there grounds for objection based in apprehension of bias, and in my view there are not, the right to object has been waived by lanepoint.
