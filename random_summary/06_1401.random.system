it thereby engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct.
in this connection i respectfully disagree with the approach taken by heerey j in duncan v lipscombe child care services inc [2006] fca 458 in which his honour said (at [6]): 'plainly s 31a was introduced to establish a lower standard for strikeouts (either of claims or defences) than that previously laid down by the high court's decisions in dey v victorian railways commissioners [1949] hca 1 ; (1948) 78 clr 62 and general steel industries inc v commissioner for railways (nsw) [1964] hca 69 ; (1964) 112 clr 125 at 130, namely that the allegations are "so clearly untenable that [they] cannot possibly succeed".
21 section 31a is not a vehicle for simply striking out parts of pleadings that are deficient.
