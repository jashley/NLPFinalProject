on 20 november 2008 the appellant filed an appeal in this court against the dismissal of the application for review by the federal magistrates court.
the minister relied on two letters in support dated 19 january and 5 february 2009 each of which notified the appellant of the time and place of the hearing and advised that the minister would seek dismissal of the appeal if the appellant failed to appear.
it was a matter for the tribunal alone to weigh the material before it and determine whether or not to accept the appellant's claims.
