however, the clear object of ss 29a and 29b is to ensure that, in some circumstances, the object of an investigation, such as persons in the position of the applicants, is not informed of the existence of a notice.
they say that the relevant examiner failed to have regard to that necessary consideration when deciding to issue a notice, in that the relevant examiner failed to consider whether it was desirable or appropriate to provide, in a notation pursuant to s 29a on each notice, that the recipient would not be prevented from making a disclosure to the applicants of the fact that documents that were the subject of legal professional privilege were required to be produced to the commission.
the privilege attaches to a document and, once privileged, the document will always be privileged.
