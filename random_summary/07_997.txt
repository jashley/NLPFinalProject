balance of convenience 38 in having regard to the balance of convenience i must give consideration to the practical consequences likely to flow from the interlocutory order sought.
the agreement is for a term of five years expiring on 31 january 2009 subject to the provisions of the agreement allowing for early termination or holding over.
even if i were satisfied that damages will not be an adequate remedy, i would nonetheless refuse the interlocutory relief sought on the basis that the strength of the socasen's case for relief in respect of the notice of termination is insufficiently strong to justify the grant of the relief sought having regard to the practical consequences likely to flow from the order sought.
