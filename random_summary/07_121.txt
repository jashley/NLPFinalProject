his honour was of the view that the court was not yet in a position to identify or assess all of the matters which must be taken into account in deciding whether to give a direction.
whilst there appears to be power to do so under s 26 , as i have said, it is in my view premature for any such order to be made.
as his honour observed, s 192 provides that in granting leave or making a direction, the court is to take into account, amongst other things, the powers which it has to make another order or to give directions in relation to evidence; see s 192(2)(e) of the evidence act .
