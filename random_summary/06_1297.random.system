20 in the events which happened, the first of the orders set out in [17] above was made by the court on 12 september 2006, and in addition i granted liberty to either party to apply on seven days notice for any interim relief that may arise for consideration.
in that regard, wieland further acknowledged the more radical factor that '... it would appear as though the wrong drawings were originally provided', but contended that wieland's expert witness mr tutin was '... of the view that the as-built drawings as opposed to the concept drawings do not take this issue very far,' whilst further acknowledging that readymix's expert, mr better, had nevertheless postulated a different view.
27 i am further of the opinion that in the exercise of the court's authority and discretion, pursuant to order 62 rule 3 of the federal court rules as to formulating orders as to costs at a stage of the proceedings prior to finalisation, wieland should be ordered, in principle, to make payment forthwith of the costs the subject of the orders presently under consideration, i favour that outcome, notwithstanding that the principal proceedings are not of course concluded.
