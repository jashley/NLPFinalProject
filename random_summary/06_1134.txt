no doubt that is the case which will be advanced at the hearing but it is presently speculative on the material before me to determine that fact.
even assuming that its present financial position, as reflected in the material now before me, as at 30 june 2006 is the consequence of the impugned conduct as asserted in the statement of claim, i do not think it is shown with any degree of satisfaction what its position would be but for that impugned conduct so as to satisfy me that its present circumstances are a consequence of that impugned conduct.
i will hear the parties as to the terms upon which that security should be provided.
