his honour considered the material in the outline of submissions to which he referred (see: [2005] fca 1655 at [6] ).
the issues which the applicant sought to raise in his outline of submissions, which sackville j considered, involve, in effect, purely a merits review of the decision of the tribunal in not accepting his evidence or being satisfied that he had established a claim to a protection visa.
moreover, i am not satisfied that the applicant will suffer any injustice if i were to refuse his application for leave to appeal.
