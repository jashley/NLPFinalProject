8 i see no point in imposing a penalty on mr fry for his breach of s 170nc of the wr act .
also given the unusual circumstances in which the breach occurred, i consider that no useful purpose would be gained by imposing a monetary penalty on the cfmeu for this breach.
the position of mr anton was unusual because he was a self-employed building contractor engaged to perform odd jobs around the hamilton site.
