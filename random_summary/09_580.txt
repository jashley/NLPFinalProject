grounds of challenge ss's grounds of challenge may be summarised as follows: the ats determination - making (1) in making the ats determination at its meeting on 5 december 2007 the board did not consider or misconstrued its powers in that: - (i) there is no evidence that the board had before it a draft of the ats determination at its meeting on 5 december 2007, and (ii) the minutes of the board's meeting (insofar as produced in a heavily redacted version --- a subject of separate complaint by ss) disclose that all the board did on 5 december 2007 was "establish" a determination.
ss's submission to the contrary is unrealistic.
under s 7d the chair of the board may convene board meetings.
