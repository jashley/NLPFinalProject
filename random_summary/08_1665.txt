the applicant's attempt to put before this court additional country information --- which he acknowledges was not before the tribunal --- is of no assistance in determining whether the tribunal committed a jurisdictional error.
it follows that these appeal grounds also cannot be sustained.
the primary judge noted that the tribunal accepted: - (i) the appellant's involvement with tntj, a tamil muslim group which fights for the rights of muslims and lower caste hindus in tamil nadu, (ii) that the appellant faced serious harm, amounting to persecution in tamil nadu due to his political opinions, religion and involvement with tntj, and (iii) that the appellant could no longer live in his village in tamil nadu.
