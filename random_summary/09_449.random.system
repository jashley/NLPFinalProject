thus, in burlington industries v exxon corporation 65 frd 26 (dmd 1974), a patent infringement action, the court said (at 37): "while certain advisory communications from the attorney to the client were not in direct response to a client request, it is evident that an ongoing attorney-client relationship existed.
there are significant differences between advice privilege and litigation privilege.
prospective clients' communications with a view to obtaining legal services are plainly covered by the attorney client privilege under californian law, regardless of whether they have retained the lawyer, and regardless of whether they ever retain the lawyer".
