that application was adjourned to today.
2 these proceedings were commenced following a decision by finkelstein j in judicial review proceedings in carey v australian securities and investments commission, vid57 of 2008, that asic was not authorised under s 50 of the asic act to cause previous federal court proceedings, vid 351 of 2007, brought in the name of the company in liquidation, and existing federal court proceedings, vid 386 of 2007, to be carried on by it in the name of ann street: carey v australian securities and investments commission [2008] fca 963.
i do not propose again to go through that litany of transactions described in previous judgments, nor the reference to overseas dealings which were said to have been at first denied by mr carey and then falsified by reference to documents that were later obtained as part of the investigative process, ancillary to the proceedings in wad 83 of 2006.
