as to order 7, there is no controversy.
as to orders 4, 5 and 6, the ambit of the controversy is that the third respondent seeks those costs on a solicitor/client basis and the applicants contend that those costs ought to be ordered on the conventional party and party basis.
the issues in controversy between the parties on each of these motions have substantially been resolved during the course of negotiations this afternoon with the result that it is common ground that the further amended statement of claim is to be struck out; the applicants are to file and serve any notice of motion to re-plead by 15 may 2009; and, the costs referred to in order 5 made on 12 march 2009 are to be payable forthwith.
