in the present case there are no facts set out or assertions made in the petition as to the likely outcome of the election other than the possibility that, because of a preference deal, the quota or a senate position may have been achieved for some other, unspecified, group.
on 3 november 2008 he filed an election petition in the high court as the court of disputed returns.
that assertion must then be understood in light of other provisions of the petition in which it is made plain that the conduct of which complaint is made is the decision of persons associated with radio or television stations not to give coverage to the petitioner's platform or press releases.
