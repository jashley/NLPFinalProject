25 the decisions of full courts of this court referred to in his honour's reasons, namely, minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs v namw [2004] fcafc 264 ; (2004) 140 fcr 572 and qaac of 2004 v refugee review tribunal [2005] fcafc 92 , show that no jurisdictional error was committed by the tribunal in failing to give particulars to the appellant of the information contained in the country information to which i have referred.
his honour found from listening to the tapes that he could hear no unfair questioning and no specific example was evident where the tribunal did not allow the appellant to answer questions on issues which were relevant to his claims.
5 the basis on which the tribunal refused the application is very appropriately summarised in the judgment of the trial judge.
