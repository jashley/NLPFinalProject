whilst i am not entirely convinced that the circumstances had so radically changed as to make the winding up proposal seem more obvious to mr tay in december 2008 than it had in july 2008 when the winding up proceedings were commenced, i do not think that the commercial concerns expressed by mr tay concerning the saleability of the land and the price that might then be obtained for it can so easily be dismissed as the plaintiffs suggest.
while the court can understand that the plaintiffs consider that gas and mr tay were somewhat intransigent in maintaining their opposition to their winding up proposal and could themselves see no good reason to delay the winding up of the company, i consider the materials before me disclose there was more than mere intransigence in the gas/tay position.
richard ah boey tay is a director of silverglow and represents gas.
