such expressions of opinion do not, in my view, betoken legal error.
3.5.3 the success (or otherwise) of the business(es) is not a relevant factor in assessing this criterion.
rather, if an applicant satisfies this criterion in respect of a failed or declining business, this should be considered in assessing whether the applicant "has overall had a successful business career".
