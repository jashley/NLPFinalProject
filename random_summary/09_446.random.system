in the absence of the ato's consent, you would need to attend on 11 march 2008 so you could be sworn in to give evidence of your separate application being afoot and the adjournment application could then be made on the basis that the tribunal ought not hear the same evidence twice.
in the result, the tribunal did not grant the adjournment requested by the applicants, and proceeded to determine their application adversely to them.
to this end we have reinstated our aat challenge referable to jolson and other matters.
