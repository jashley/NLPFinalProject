it suffices to note that the occasion for each of the adjournments appears to have been correspondence directed by or on behalf of ganter to the deputy commissioner indicating that the company was in the process of obtaining finance to enable it to pay the debt due in full and a corresponding request to the registrar by the deputy commissioner to adjourn the application.
that was that the winding up application ought to be dismissed on its next return date, ie 13 november 2008.
the application for the winding up of ganter was made by the deputy commissioner upon the filing of the application in this court on 20 august 2008.
