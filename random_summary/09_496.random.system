the orders which i made on 30 march 2009 were interlocutory.
i have been informed from the bar table that the actual costs incurred by the applicant are of the order of $62,000.
for these reasons i propose to make the following additional order: i direct that, in the event that the respondent fails to comply with order 2 above, simon walter johnson, the solicitor for the applicant, be appointed by the court to do all things (including executing all instruments, documents or things, whether in the name of the respondent or otherwise) as may be necessary to effect a change of the respondent's name from its current name to its acn and any other words that s 147 of the corporations act 2001 (cth) requires.
