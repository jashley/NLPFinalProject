in szmtc v minister for immigration and citizenship [2009] fca 162 at [5] buchanan j referred to the language of " special reasons " in o 52 r 15 when considering an application for an extension of time in relation to an " ordinary appeal " and observed that " no lesser test should be employed when considering an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal ".
neither the applicant nor the respondent minister contended that recourse should be had to contents of that book for the purposes of resolving the present application .
to the extent that it is possible to give content to the grounds of appeal as formulated in the proposed notice of appeal , it would appear that the applicant seeks to again agitate those issues previously canvassed before the federal magistrate.
