i look forward to events between the date of the board's decision and my decision, i must have regard to mr toohey's failure to lodge returns for the 2006 year indicates that he has not learned to manage his professional affairs so that he can meet his obligations despite the difficulties that we all face.
7 from the outset i acknowledge that the tribunal did discuss the ultimate issue of whether the applicant was the prescribed fit and proper person.
if a conviction, act or omission of the applicant is not disregarded, it will need to be assessed, along with other factors, in order to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper person if that inquiry can still be made where the disqualifying factors do not apply.
