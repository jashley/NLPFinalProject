whilst in or around mid march 2009, my and mr. wayman's respective wives, as controllers of our respective family trust companies, yohme and alhumbra investments pty limited, executed a form of share transfer in favour of the fourth defendant and fifth defendant, with the intention that the asset would be removed and thereby preserved, the share transfers remained undated, with no ultimate agreement to effect registration.
on 7 april 2009 a 'change to company details' document was lodged with the australian securities &amp; investments commission in relation to the first defendant.
it would also seem to me open to mr whitton, who has been added as a plaintiff, to seek relief in respect of his purported removal from office as a director of the first defendant by the purported circulating resolution of 7 december 2009 of queensland resource investments pty limited and robsan investment holdings pty limited.
