by policies of insurance called "instant profits insurance --- cash flow insurance --- simplified business interruption insurance", the respondent, qbe insurance (australia) limited, agreed to indemnify the applicant, first, for the period 31 october 2005 to 31 october 2006 (2005 policy) and, second, for the period 31 october 2006 to 31 october 2007 (2006 policy), for "an amount in respect of weekly loss of turnover suffered ... if the business is interrupted or interfered with due to ... property ... having sustained ... loss or damage".
relevantly the exclusion clause provides: "we will not pay for ... [a]ny loss or claim under this policy after the expiration of: (a) [o]ne year from the end of the period of insurance; (b) [t]hree months from the date on which payment shall have been made or liability admitted by the insurers covering the loss or damage giving rise to the said claim unless such claim shall have in the meantime been referred to arbitration or legal action".
the first question to be determined is how loss of turnover is to be calculated under the policies.
