6 the applicant also said in his affidavit that he made arrangements with a mr hamid 'to attend final hearing regardless of whether i made it to the hearing or not on 12 december 2007'.
the grounds of appeal to the fmca raised no cogent issue in relation to these findings, which were a matter for assessment by the rrt.
however the matters to which he referred in his affidavit, accepting them at face value, do not, in my view, constitute any reason why the judgment given on 12 december 2007 should be recalled.
