however, to require merck to give discovery of documents concerning events after the grant of the patent would, in my opinion, entirely skew the process of discovery and be incongruent with the balance referred to by kiefel j in the passage quoted above.
it introduces a new statutory test for summary disposal of a proceeding.
it seeks that discovery be limited in two ways: that documents relating to experimental work using the processes claimed in the patent or steps taken therein and any testing or evaluation of the processes claim in the patent of steps therein conducted after the date of the grant are excluded; and that documents relating to the process used by the respondent in manufacturing its commercial product, including documents relating to the adaptation of the processes claim in the patent from the laboratory to the manufacturing plant, are excluded.
