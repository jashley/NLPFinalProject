first, the tribunal had difficulty in getting the appellant to provide a clear account of what he had been doing between 2006 (when he left the city and returned to his farm) and february 2008 (when he departed nepal for australia).
plainly it was not prepared to find that the material facts alleged by the appellant were so or not sufficiently made out to support a finding he was a person to whom protection should be afforded under the convention.
however, the question of a subjective fear was never directly addressed by the tribunal and i am not prepared to find that the generalised rejection of his material claims extends to an unexpressed finding that he lacked a subjective fear of persecution if her were to return to his country of origin.
