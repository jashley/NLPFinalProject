as i said in my reasons of 6 february 2009, circumstances have changed considerably since the hearing in 2007 and my reasons of 10 december 2007.
the first aspect, which they describe as pre-hearing costs, is effectively limited to the question of the pleadings.
i consider that it is a great pity that one or other of them was not accepted, but i do not consider that the failure to accept it interferes with the ordinary exercise of discretion for the making of a costs order.
