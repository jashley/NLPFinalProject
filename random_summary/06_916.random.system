the making of a gross sum costs order is only a means of quantifying the amount of the costs entitlement, alternative to the taxation processes otherwise provided for in o 62.
allowance should nevertheless be made for the fact that some work properly carried out for the purposes of solicitor/client taxation may be excluded for the purposes of party/party taxation.
the real issue is whether costs orders in favour of the respondents should be made at all.
