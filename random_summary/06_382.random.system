1 the present application filed on 1 december 2005 is for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal from the judgment of smith fm delivered on 8 november 2005, whereby his honour found that the decision of the refugee review tribunal handed down on 17 june 2005 adversely to the present applicant was not affected by jurisdictional error.
4 the applicant filed a supporting affidavit in this court, presumably handwritten by another person on her behalf, which sought to explain the reasons for her delay in making the present application, and in which she detailed her practice of the falun gong religion in china.
