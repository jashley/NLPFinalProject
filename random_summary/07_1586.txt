the updating of normal weekly earnings for former employees under the existing subsection 8(9) has, however, become problematic due to the increasingly decentralised nature of wage fixing.
the reason for the replacement of a percentage determined by the operation of law or an industrial agreement by a prescribed percentage is explained in the explanatory memorandum.
16 before amendment, s 8(9) of the src act provided for the matters now encompassed in ss 8(9) and 8(9a) of the act but did not distinguish between persons who are employees or those no longer employed: if the minimum amount per week payable in respect of employees included in a class of employees of which the employee was a member at the date of the injury is increased or reduced on or after that date as a result of: a) the operation of a law of the commonwealth or of a state or territory; or b) the making, alteration, or operation of an award, order, determination or industrial agreement, or of the doing of any other act or thing, under such a law; the normal weekly earnings of the employee before the injury, as calculated under the preceding subsections, shall be increased or reduced by the same percentage as the percentage by which that minimum amount was so increased or reduced, as the case may be.
