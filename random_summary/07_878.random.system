the trial had occupied nine sitting days.
the applicant pleaded causes of action in rectification, contractual breach of a lease, waste, unconscionable conduct contrary to ss 51aa and 51ac of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) and contraventions of ss 52 and 53 (g) of that act and sought various forms of relief.
although it may be accepted, in the present case, that the trial may have been somewhat shorter had the respondent conceded the breach of the lease, this, in my opinion, is not sufficient to warrant a departure from the consequences prescribed by o 23 r 11(5).
