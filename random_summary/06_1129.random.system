it is enough for me to hold (as i do) that the mistake is of such importance that it warrants the tribunal pressing ahead with the application.
on this application, none of the facts are in dispute.
the reason is that i read the words "offers" when first used in clause d to refer not only to the initial offers to shareholders but also to any varied offers provided the variation increases the offer price to more than $1.45 per share.
