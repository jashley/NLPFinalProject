finally, although the respondents were successful pursuant to their notice of motion filed 12 september 2007 in obtaining an order excluding certain affidavit evidence, they were unsuccessful in relation to their claim for a permanent stay, which was an important issue requiring determination in respect of that notice of motion.
the second respondent appeared to take no active part in the proceedings.
those submissions were filed and served, and i take them into account for the purposes of delivery of this judgment.
