(3) the court may make an order under subrule (2) at any time, whether or not an order that costs be paid to a person has previously been made or entered.
the orders were made in favour of niugini mining against mr salfinger on 30 march 2007 (the injunction order), 29 august 2007 (the adjournment order) and 18 october 2007 (the separate question order).
it is apparent from the affidavit of mr lobban that the gross sum costs orders sought are significantly less than the amount of the costs actually paid by niugini mining.
