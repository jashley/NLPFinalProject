28 i propose to make an order for security for costs which is a discounted amount from the proposed schedule.
the total amount of costs in connection with mr burgess's appeal are said to amount to $3,439, although some categories of costs may not have been included in the schedule.
15 the considerations include whether the application for security for costs has been brought promptly; an assessment of the strength of the merits of the appeal and the bona fides of the appellant in bringing the appeal; whether the impecuniosity of the appellant was caused and, i might add, contributed to by the conduct of the respondents; whether the application for security for costs, in all the circumstances, is oppressive having regard to the circumstances of the appellant; whether there are persons who otherwise have an interest in the outcome of the proceedings; and other general discretionary questions going to the public interest.
