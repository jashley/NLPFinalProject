the applicant cautioned its members that the benefits so provided may not be sufficient to cover the expenses in fact incurred, and encouraged them to take out travel insurance.
57 applying this line of jurisprudence to the circumstances of the present case, there are two particular matters which have the potential to stand between the applicant and the conclusion which it seeks, namely, that it was charitable in the years to which this proceeding relates.
26 in contending that it was, in the years in question, a charitable institution, the applicant relied upon the following facts and circumstances: &#8226; the provision of a special premium for family cover where the member was a serving member of the armed forces; &#8226; the continuation of cover where members and their families travelled interstate or overseas; &#8226; the facility for unlimited suspension of membership; &#8226; the special treatment accorded to personnel discharging from the armed forces; &#8226; the composition of its board, and the role of the chief of navy in relation to the applicant; and &#8226; its practical focus, in its marketing and other activities, upon navy personnel and the advantages to them of contributing to the applicant's fund.
