second, the respondent says that the evidence is potentially relevant to its defence based on provisions of the workers compensation act 1987 (nsw) and the safety, rehabilitation and compensation act 1988 (cth) which preclude claims for damages in respect of an injury sustained by an employee in the course of his or her employment.
in these circumstances, as the proceedings are presently constituted, there is no proper basis upon which i could or would require the applicant to attend a medical examination against his will.
