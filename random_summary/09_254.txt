the approach which i ought to take in this application is, in my view, covered by what was said by finkelstein j in black &amp; decker (australasia) pty ltd v gmca pty limited [2007] fca 1623 at paragraphs 4 to 5.
whilst i am, of course, mindful of the principles relating to an order for indemnity costs laid down in cases such as colgate-palmolive company v cussons pty limited [1993] fca 536 ; (1993) 46 fcr 225 , it seems to me that this is an appropriate case to order that the costs thrown away be paid on an indemnity basis.
the claim as presently constituted was based on the allegation, in particular, that the misleading conduct of mr heraghty and mr mcgrath amounted to a failure to disclose the arrangements after the sale date under a share sale agreement dated 25 august 2005, in which yrb acquired the remaining shares in the communications group holdings pty limited which it did not then own.
