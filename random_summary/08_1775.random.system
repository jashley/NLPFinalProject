it was said that mswd at its walter withers stores never, or almost never, sells suits for the full marked price of $799 or $899.
however, the relevant allegation is not that mswd advertised the offer during a limited time, but that it advertised an offer which was to run only for a limited time.
the position is no different when the seller is offering to sell two articles for a given price.
