11 in the first affidavit, mr cooper says that the defendant's sole director, mr peuckert, is prepared to assist with the company's business during the period of administration.
the plaintiff is by far the largest creditor of the defendant and is identified by mr cooper as being owed $123,282.85.
neither of those failures by the plaintiff are such that it could be said that the defendant was caused a substantial injustice and, in those circumstances, s 467a would operate to prevent the dismissal of the application.
