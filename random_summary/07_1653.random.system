2 the appellants are citizens of indonesia who arrived in australia on 9 december 2005.
the tribunal accepted that the home of the appellants was destroyed in the incident on 9 november 2005 and this would be sufficient for them to fear for their safety and to want to leave, however this did not bring the appellants under the refugees convention definition of a refugee.
the appellants claimed that the police reported on television that they had been able to storm the house because of information received from a neighbour.
