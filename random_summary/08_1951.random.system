issue 5 --- is the commissioner's demand under s 60 valid?
however for the purposes of s 5 of the tariff act, the critical question in my view is whether objectively speaking the goods in question can be said to have emerged from a process as a "new and different article ... having a distinctive character or use": see jax tyres 5 fcr at 264 (lockhart j).
the very thing the section is concerned with is the loss of goods (for example, their disappearance without adequate explanation) or the movement of goods into home consumption while subject to control and without the payment of duty.
