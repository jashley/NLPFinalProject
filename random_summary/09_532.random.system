again, i am satisfied that there is no difficulty in the lehman brothers being required to produce the notifications, to insurers a and b, that were made in late 2007, referred to in its solicitor's affidavit.
that includes the power to preserve the efficacy of the execution that would lie against a prospective judgment debtor.
lehman brothers argues that the discretionary considerations attaching to the conduct of such proceedings and the fact that there is a large body of potential group members who may be affected, are grounds for confining the exercise of a similar discretion in favour of production of the insurance documents in a case such as the present.
