7 for this reason, both motions were heard together, and the issues determined on the basis of whether there is any merit in masu's objections to paras 38 to 44 as they appear in the proposed further amended statement of claim.
to my mind, the opening words "subject to ... subsection 1013c(2)" in s 1013d and "subject to subsection 1013c(2)" in s 1013e suggest that this is so, as do the opening two lines of s 1013c(2) (set out at [28] above).
28 masu, however, refers to s 1013c(2) of the act which provides, relevantly: the information required by sections 1013d and 1013e need only be included in the product disclosure statement to the extent to which it is actually known to: (a) the responsible person; and (b) ...; and (c) ...; and (d) any person: (i) named in the statement as a financial services licensee providing services in relation to the issue or sale of the financial product; and (ii) who participated in any way in the preparation of the statement; and (e) ...; and (f) ...; and (g) if any of the above persons is a body corporate--any director of that body corporate.
