if we had known in opening of a submission that paragraphs 78 and 79 of mr phillpot's affidavit were deliberately misleading, we would have sought to recall rebuttal evidence in the course of trial.
mr phillpot was not on notice that hawthorn glen would make this submission as to his credit and reliability as a witness and to that extent the rule in browne v dunn was not complied with and i propose to disregard that submission in forming an assessment as to mr phillpot's credit and reliability as a witness.
he was not on notice that it would be submitted that he had carefully crafted paragraphs 78 and 79 so as to obfuscate or confuse what his real intention was.
