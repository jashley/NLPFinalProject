4 these principles were also summarised in a decision of stone j, dorajay pty limited v aristocrat leisure limited [2005] fca 588 at [12] to [18].
3 the parties accept that the relevant principles in relation to an application to set aside a subpoena are those which have effectively been summarised in taylor sc, p, ritchie's uniform civil procedure nsw (lexisnexis, subscription service) at [33.4.10] to [33.4.30], in particular that: (1) a subpoena, or part of a subpoena, may be set aside if it constitutes an abuse of process in the sense that the subpoena seeks production of documents other than for a legitimate forensic purpose.
it seems to me to be clear that the test of apparent relevance has to be applied at the time the subpoena is issued by reference to the pleadings as they exist at that time.
