i propose to treat the grounds recited in the notice of appeal as the proposed grounds of error on the part of the federal magistrates court in refusing to exercise the discretion so as to set aside the dismissal order.
accordingly i submit that i was denied natural justice.
the appellant appeals from a decision of the federal magistrates court of australia made on 18 july 2008 refusing an application to set aside orders made by that court on 19 june 2008 dismissing an application for the issue of the constitutional writs in relation to a decision of the refugee review tribunal (the "tribunal") affirming the decision of the minister's delegate to deny the appellant a protection visa under the provisions of the migration act 1958 (cth).
