further, as already stated, the first and second respondents' conduct (e.g., the last minute and short-term retainer of legal representatives, the failure to take steps promptly to have a subpoena issued to mr guss, the failure to cooperate with their own legal advisers and/or to attend court) delayed the hearing of the motion and increased the costs associated with it.
27 the respondents relied on three affidavits of barry armitage, an affidavit of christopher armitage and an affidavit of joan armitage.
the first to fourth respondents were in breach of two separate court orders (of 8 october 2003 and 16 december 2003) for the provision of these lists.
