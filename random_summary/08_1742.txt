1 the appellants, primelife corporation ltd and its managing director, eduard christiaan sent, appeal (alternatively seek leave to appeal) against a judgment of the federal magistrates court of australia, given on 14 december 2007, wherein an application under s 178 of the bankruptcy act 1966 (cth) ("the bankruptcy act ") by the now first respondent, giovanni bufalo ("the respondent"), against the now second respondent, the official trustee in bankruptcy ("the trustee"), was dismissed.
the issue is whether his honour was in error in the basis and justification of the apportionment which he undertook.
58 there is, in my view, no substance in the omnibus submission that the federal magistrate ought to have given the appellants their costs generally, simply upon the basis that they were a party to a proceeding in which the respondent had failed to secure the remedy which he sought.
