i understand that there is no longer any claim by the applicants with respect to alleged criminal conduct by the second, third and fourth respondents.
the application was not specifically opposed by the respondents, however it was also not by consent.
the matter has been fully litigated in the state courts; significantly, the jurisdiction of the federal court to entertain the claims in the applicants' statement of claim has not been established.
