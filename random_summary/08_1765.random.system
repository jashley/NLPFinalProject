23 as indicated at [51] of its reasons in seovic , the full court was prepared to act on the assumption that re greenhill and re emerson correctly state the law, that is, that an overstatement in a bankruptcy notice of the amount in fact due renders the notice invalid, whether or not the overstatement could reasonably mislead the debtor, if a notice complying with the requirements of s 41(5) has been duly given.
but where the bankruptcy notice overstated the amount actually due and the debtor gave a notice in accordance with the proviso, the bankruptcy notice was invalid.
[45] section 16(2) of the 1913 act was reproduced as proviso (ii) to s 2(1) of the bankruptcy act 1914 (uk).
