the issue was whether mr mehta bore an onus of proof in his application and whether the decision requiring concurrent filing of evidence shifted the onus of proof from mr mehta and created a joint onus.

the second ground was that an error of law was committed in the course of the conduct because the determination had the effect that somnomed bore the onus of proof.
