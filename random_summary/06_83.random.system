12 on 7 july 2005, a licensed enquiry agent, mr bernard delaney attended maskiell's house in gilston in queensland.
if a significant number of the imported products were imported for the sole purpose of assisting corrs, and therefore were not imported for any commercial purpose, i would have expected maskiell to have clearly stated that at the relevant time to australian customs and to corrs with whom she was in contact.
even when proceedings are taken by the individual to secure the benefit of an order or undertaking that has not been complied with, there is also a public interest aspect in the sense that the proceedings also vindicate the court's authority.
