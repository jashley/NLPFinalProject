adequate provision is made by the high court rules for a justice of that court to determine whether or not the registrar shall issue the process in question.
there is little doubt that if a registrar refuses to accept a document for filing or seeks the direction of a judge in relation to that document on the basis of the person's litigious history (unless perhaps the history is revealed on the face of the document itself), the registrar has not confined himself or herself to a consideration of the relevant document 'on its face'.
it is a power given to the registrar directly by the federal court rules .
