his honour accordingly dismissed the application pursuant to r 44.12(1)(a) of the federal magistrates court rules 2001 (cth) ('the fmc rules').
while it was satisfied that the applicant had had some involvement with falun gong in australia, the tribunal disregarded the evidence of her conduct in australia under s 91r(3) of the migration act 1958 (cth) ('the act') as it was not satisfied that she had engaged in the activities otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening her claims to be a refugee.
the affidavit also alleges that the federal magistrate did not consider the information provided by the applicant.
