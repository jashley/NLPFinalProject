they say that the request is inconsistent with the terms and content of practice note 14, which provides the court will not order general discovery as a matter of course even when a consent direction is submitted.
paragraph 3 8 this request is for all documents and other records concerning the management, ownership and possession of the ship "la pampa" from 27 march 2001 to 1 may 2003.
i think this casts the obligation too broadly.
