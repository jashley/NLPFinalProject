the applicants submitted that the words in the section of the undirected proxies marked "step 1" did not amount to an indication or instruction to the chairman to vote as the chairman saw fit.
in relation to the allegation that the chairman breached cl 50.6 of the constitution the company contended that: (a) the appointment of a proxy contained in the proxy form did not provide instructions as to how the proxy was to vote or alternatively, the only instruction was one to the effect that the proxy could vote as the proxy saw fit; (b) the appointment of the proxy did not indicate the manner in which the proxy would vote on any resolution; (c) the words "the chairman of the meeting intends to vote undirected proxies in favour of each item of business" appearing in the section headed "step 2" where none of the "for", "against" and "abstain" boxes had been marked by the member in respect of any item of business did not form part of the appointment of the proxy.
this included a tally of the votes represented in the proxy forms which were referred to by computershare as "open-useable" proxies, that is to say proxy forms where no direction had been given by the member submitting the proxy to the chairman as to whether the chairman should vote for or against resolutions or abstain from voting on resolutions.
