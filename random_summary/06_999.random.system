in re roberts; ex parte australian telecom employees credit co-operative limited (1982) 84 flr 88, sweeney j held that a loan contract which provided that the borrower should execute an equitable charge in favour of the lender over the relevant real property and agreed to the lodging of a caveat to protect that interest, created a security in favour of the creditor.
i am of opinion that s 44(5) does not permit wright designed to claim falsely in the petition that it holds no security and, if that is proved wrong, to turn around and say that it could present the petition anyway without having voluntarily offered, under s 44(3) , to surrender the security for the benefit of creditors generally.
until such registration occurred, wright designed's interest in land existed only in equity in the sense explained in chan v cresdon pty limited [1989] hca 63 ; (1989) 168 clr 242.
