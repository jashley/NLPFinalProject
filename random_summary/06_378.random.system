i asked him why the reasons which his honour the trial judge gave for dismissing his application summarily on the basis of the federal magistrates court rules disclosed an error of law.
the order for costs that i make should not include the costs of that appearance.
i adopt the reasons which i gave on 1 march 2006, before i had the benefit of hearing the applicant, as explaining the reasons in law why i am of opinion that there would be no sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave on the basis of the material before me today and i am not satisfied that there would be any injustice caused to the applicant, let alone a substantial injustice by my refusing him leave to appeal.
