once that event had occurred, the deed of option, not the posa, became the sole source of bp's powers, rights and remedies to have the lansvale site reconveyed to it.
in particular, bp had a right to terminate in circumstances where there had been any failure by ringrow to perform any obligation imposed on it by the agreement; where ringrow attempted or purported to assign the agreement in breach of it, or where it had breached its obligations in relation to the sale of bp products from the lansvale site or had attempted to dispose, or allow the disposal, of the site (cl 13.2.1).
while the posa could have provided for the well known formula on which costs are recoverable by the mortgagee under its contractual rights on the widest possible basis, instead of using that means cl a16.9(a) achieved the same result by requiring ringrow to reimburse bp for any costs incurred by bp.
