irrespective of this, the respondent has been put to expense by legal proceedings in the form of this appeal, and this appeal has now been rendered nugatory by the appellant successfully applying to have the original judgment set aside and a fresh application determined by the federal magistrates court.
in my view this would be inappropriate.
the respondent ought to have ascertained if the decision was actually posted or not before bringing an application for summary judgment before jarrett fm.
