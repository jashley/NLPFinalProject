the applicant (mr spalla) stated his position on costs in a letter addressed to my associate dated 17 october 2006.
28 when the trial began on monday, 14 march 2006, junior counsel for mr spalla announced an appearance with senior counsel, stating that senior counsel was unwell.
save for the first four days of the hearing, mr spalla was self-represented, although i accept, as mr rambaldi notes, that mr spalla continued to rely on the work that his legal representatives had done after they had ceased to represent him.
