if by this ground, the applicant means to suggest that the tribunal is unable to make inquiries of an applicant during a review hearing and rely on the answers given, then i consider the ground is misconceived and without merit.
it seems the intent of the ground is that by asking questions the tribunal invited the provision of information the tribunal then did not have, and so attracted the obligations specified in s 424 of the act which it did not comply with.
further, s 422b of the act suggests that there is no residual procedural fairness requirements to give another hearing extraneous to div 4 of pt 7.
