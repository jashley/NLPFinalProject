consistent with its approach to the partnerships since the succession day, the applicant treated the partnerships as being still in existence for income tax purposes on 1 july 2002 and therefore reset the "tax cost" of the underlying assets of the partnerships to the market value of those assets as at 1 july 2002.
a distinction must be drawn between the "continuity" of a partnership and the continuing existence of a partnership with only one partner.
it not clear to me that this is an example of the principle which the applicant put forward.
