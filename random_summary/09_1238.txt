in addition to the two affidavits of mr coulthart, the applicant filed affidavits of belinda nicole dixon and jessica williams on 22 october 2009.
the evidence from mr wang is that the respondent's one way vision product, as identified in the immediate statement of claim, is not used and is not suitable for use in conjunction with screen printing.
