i must say that, for myself, i find the proposition that an offer may be 'not fair' and yet still 'reasonable' one which presents some difficulty.
it is grant samuel's judgement that, if no superior proposal emerges prior to the scheme meeting, there are sufficient reasons for shareholders to vote for the proposal notwithstanding that it is not in the fair range value.
on 1 october 2009, by order 1, i approved, pursuant to s 411(1) , the explanatory memorandum and scheme booklet in its final form.
