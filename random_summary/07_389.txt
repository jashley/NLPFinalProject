this is applicable to an agreement certified pursuant to the act (see kenross contractors pty ltd v warren (2005) 147 ir 390) the certified agreement being an instrument made by an authority (s 46).
consequently it is uncertain when the 2002 agreement would expire so that cl 1.3.2 is unenforceable.
' in my opinion the effect of the giving of the notice by the applicant pursuant to s 170mi was to initiate the statutory bargaining process which took legal priority over any provision of the 2002 agreement and so over cl 1.3.2.
