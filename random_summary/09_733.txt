the general deterrence factor may be relevant in a number of ways: (a) the nature of the offence may be such that visa refusal or cancellation may deter others from committing similar offences; and (b) the visa refusal or cancellation in respect of a non-citizen who has been involved in a criminal scheme or schemes may discourage or prevent another person or persons from engaging in similar schemes.
the applicant contended that the tribunal's consideration of general deterrence miscarried; although the tribunal considered relevant principles, it disregarded or failed to apply those principles to the particular facts of the applicant's case.
the tribunal, in so concluding, accepted that general deterrence (paragraph 2.5(c)) was relevant to the first of these primary factors (protection of the australian community) but concluded that it was not a decisive or even a substantial factor.
