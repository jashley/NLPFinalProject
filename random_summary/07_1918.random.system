while the tribunal agreed that the appellant would most likely be questioned on his return, if for no other reason than that he has been outside the country for 26 years, it did not consider that he would be persecuted.
in my view, in relation to his honour's consideration of the findings of the tribunal with respect to these issues, no error appears from the decision of his honour.
the findings the tribunal made were open to it on the evidence &#8226; even if the tribunal's findings were against the evidence and the weight of the evidence, such a result does not give rise to an error of law &#8226; there is no basis for the assertion that the tribunal failed to take into account relevant evidence.
