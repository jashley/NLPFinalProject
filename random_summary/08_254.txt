please make arrangements for security to be provided in this sum as soon as possible either by way of bank guarantee or cash.
the matter proceeding during the week commencing monday, 26 november 2007 up to and including friday, 30 november 2007.
in the circumstances of this case, including the existence of the previous security order, the inclusion of a provision for liberty to apply and the absence of any evidence of prejudice, i do not consider that there is any basis for a finding that the lapse of time since the original order weighs against the making of an order for further security.
