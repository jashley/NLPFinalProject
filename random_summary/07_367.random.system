to the extent that the sections use the term 'relevant offence' in subdivision b, that term includes a reference to an offence against subs 8k(1), (1b), 8l(1), (1a), or ss 8n, 8q, 8t, or 8u, an offence against the crimes (taxation offences) act 1980 (cth) and an offence against s 6 of the crimes act , ss 11.1, 11.4, 11.5 of the criminal code (which have a relationship with tax-related conduct prescribed by provisions of subdivision b) or an offence against ss 134.1, 134.2, 135.1, 135.2, or 135.4 of the criminal code being offences that relate to a tax liability (s 8j(3)).

since an obligation of disclosure of the arrangements cannot be established based upon any construct or inference derived from the deed of settlement itself nor any contended commitment on the part of the commissioner not to properly analyse the conduct of the applicants in connection with any possible tax-related activity that might find expression in the commission of criminal offences, how can it be said to be 'unfair' as an improper exercise of power, not to disclose the arrangements.
