on 23 january 2006 the respondents filed an amended defence and cross-claim.
in support of the second point that there has been a material change in the proceeding since the last order for security for costs was made in october 2006, the respondents relied upon three matters: the proceedings have been significantly delayed and, the proceedings are now, in mid-2009, no further progressed than they were in mid-2006; since october 2006 the respondents have incurred significant costs; because of significant amendments to the applicant's case the respondents' preparation for trial will need to be more extensive.
the hearing of the applicant's notice of motion dated 12 june 2007 to amend its further amended statement of claim be adjourned to 9.30am on 4 september 2007.
