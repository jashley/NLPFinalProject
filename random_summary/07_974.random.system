while of importance, in my view the litigation in this case was not of itself of such "public interest" as to warrant a departure from usual rules as to costs.
as was made clear by my judgment, the dd act protects the rights of aggrieved persons and provides statutory authority for such persons to make complaints.
at a practical level, if one looks at another case and takes one or two factors said to be analogous and supporting a particular conclusion, there will almost inevitably be other factors distinguishable or pointing the other way.
