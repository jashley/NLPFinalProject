3 the application by the minister is for an order that the reasons, transcript and written submissions relating to the appeal not be published until after the determination of any special leave application before the high court.
it suffices to observe that shortly after the judgment was handed down, counsel for the first respondent ("the minister") contacted my chambers to signal that an application for non-publication of the reasons of that judgment would be made.
i heard the application, sitting as a single judge.
