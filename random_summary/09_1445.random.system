in balenzuela , the high court held that, where material evidence had been erroneously rejected at the instance of a party who succeeded in the case, the unsuccessful party was entitled to a new trial unless it was shown that the evidence would not have affected the outcome: see at 232, per dixon cj; 239, per menzies j; and 242 --- 243, per windeyer j.
i should say at once that i am uncomfortable, as a single judge of this court, adopting the " clear prima facie error " approach in deciding whether leave should be given to appeal the decision of another single judge of this court.
however, the primary judge made it clear to mr lawrence from the outset that his leave to appear for channel did not extend to the pre-trial mediation, or to the trial itself.
