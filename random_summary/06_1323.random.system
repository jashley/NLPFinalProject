45 mr bigmore also advanced an argument which, if correct, would mean that mr meinhardt ceased to be under any obligation to repay to the applicant the sum which was lent to him on 31 january 2001.
mr laurie smith, the applicant's managing director, who gave evidence by affidavit and viva voce, agreed under cross-examination that there ought to be journals and ledgers in the books and records of the applicant showing from whom the $hk12,100,000.00 was received, to whom it was credited and how it was dealt with subsequently.
the applicant alleges that, at the time of mr meinhardt's death, and at the present time, a debt of not less than $2,000 was and is owing by mr meinhardt, and by his estate, to the applicant, such as to give the applicant a cause of action under s 244(1) of the bankruptcy act.
