mr mcilroy deposed that he immediately returned to the go-line but that he did not drive the truck in an erratic or dangerous manner or at an excessive speed; and that in his view, based on his experience as a driver, it was appropriate to turn off the truck immediately as the engine had barely "warmed up".
in particular: &#8226; in relation to mr mcilroy: o mr mcilroy was not censured at the time for this incident &#8226; in relation to ms st henry driving her truck on to a 750 mm rock: o ms st henry had already received a one-shift suspension o after the incident she continued driving the truck for several hours indicating that the truck tyre was not damaged o this was ms st henry's first offence of this nature o no other driver who had been suspended for a similar incident had been dismissed.
in my view no issue turned on whether the conversation occurred on 10 may or 11 may 2006.
