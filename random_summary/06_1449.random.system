whilst the solicitor for the minister has submitted that there are differences between this case and the underlying factual situation of that case, it seems to me that the applicant should not be shut out from seeking to bring himself within the rather ample boundaries set by that case if it is to be regarded as good law, and for present purposes i must so regard it.
to say he has the right to sue his solicitor is of no comfort in a case of this kind.
ground 5 was not put before the learned federal magistrate and should not be permitted on appeal.
