it is difficult to find any reasonable basis for construing the threatened court 'proceedings' as being limited to louis vuitton's trade mark infringement claims.
when that letter was sent, corrs was aware that maskiell still had no legal representation and it was also clear to corrs and maskiell that the 'repeated and blatant re-infringements' referred to in the letter were capable of amounting to a very serious contempt.
maskiell pleaded guilty to the charges and i am satisfied that they have been proved beyond reasonable doubt against both maskiell and design elegance.
