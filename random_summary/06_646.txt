the respondent, on the other hand, does not have a right to apply for its costs of the proceedings.
8 section 67 of the src act contains a prima facie rule that each party bears its own costs with the proviso that a successful applicant has the right to ask for costs from the respondent, subject to the exercise of the tribunal's discretion.
accordingly, it is open to the respondent to approach the court for an order for costs at this later stage.
