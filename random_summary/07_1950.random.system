i certify that the preceding forty-one (41) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice collier.
even with the qualification to s 91r(2)(a) , which the respondent submits must operate to exclude from its scope, threat which do not have the capacity to instil fear, it is clear that that application of the (claimant's) definition would be productive of anomalous consequences... ... (at 412) counsel for the respondent contended in written submissions that 'if an applicant fears he or she will lose their life there is no doubt the harm feared would constitute persecution'.
i accept as correct the respondent's submissions that there was no need in the instant case for the tribunal to turn to the question of whether there had been a failure of state protection until the tribunal had first concluded that the applicant had a well founded fear of being persecuted for a convention reason and that the requirements of section 91r of the act had been met.
