8 in applying those principles, i am of the view that on the evidence, there is no absence of good faith or error of law or principle in the decision of the plaintiffs to enter into the agreement, nor are there any real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the plaintiffs' entry into the agreement.
14 i will make the orders in terms of the claim for relief which has been filed in court.
2 the plaintiffs now seek relief to the effect that the agreement be approved and that the court direct that the plaintiffs may act on the agreement as though it had been approved by the court pursuant to s 477(2b) of the act.
