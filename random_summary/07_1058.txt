22 in my view, the applicant underestimated the impact of the other material (in addition to the evidence of professors peach and fox) before the tribunal and, in particular, the evidence of dr collins who was called by the respondent.
53 undoubtedly the tribunal is entitled to rely upon material to inform itself as it sees fit, but it must accord the parties procedural fairness and comply with s 39 of the aat act.
whilst i have come to the view that there is sufficient evidence to support the findings of the tribunal even on the basis of the temporal issues, the necessity for such evidence is not to be assumed.
