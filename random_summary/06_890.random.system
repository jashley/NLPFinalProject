10 on 17 august 2005, the applicant limited his application to the tribunal to his request for documents said to have been provided by him to the respondent in 1991.
it seems that the applicant had a right of appeal on a question of law from the decision of the tribunal under s 44 of the administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth) ('the aat act'), but he has not exercised that right.
he did not articulate his submission clearly, but i take him to be saying that, although he was not deprived of an opportunity to call evidence at the hearing, and did not ask for an adjournment of the hearing so that he could gather and present evidence challenging mr norman's evidence, nevertheless, the tribunal should have given him an opportunity to challenge mr norman's evidence by suggesting an adjournment or perhaps adjourning of its own motion.
