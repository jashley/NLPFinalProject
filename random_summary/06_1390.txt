this submission was very faintly put, and it is sufficient for me to conclude, as i do, that there are no circumstances warranting a costs order of the kind which the second respondent seeks.
save to the extent necessary to address the rather ambiguous position of the named executors, i propose to confine myself to questions of costs as they have arisen as between the parties to the litigation.
the applicant made an application before a court, respondents were joined and, at least as far as the applicant and the second respondent are concerned, the matter proceeded as a conventional adversarial contest.
