i conclude that it would probably not have been possible to obtain a hearing before the court of appeal a significant time (perhaps any time) ahead of the hearing of the application for leave to appeal.
the court was invited on 13 september 2005 to note that, on or before 27 september 2005, mr george elias would procure an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee in favour of the trustee in the amount of $80 000.00 which the trustee would be entitled to call upon should the appeal from the judgment of the district court be dismissed, withdrawn or discontinued.
failure to obtain a stay 13 mr george elias could have sought a stay of execution from the district court.
