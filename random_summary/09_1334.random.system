generally this will not involve the court making findings on the evidence on which the state relies, but it might consider that evidence for the limited purpose of being satisfied that the state is acting in good faith and rationally: see munn (for and on behalf of the gunggari people) v queensland [2001] fca 1229 ; (2001) 115 fcr 109 at [29] - [30] , per emmett j; lovett on behalf of the gunditjmara people v state of victoria [2007] fca 474 at [37] , per north j; smith v state of western australia [2000] fca 1249 ; (2000) 104 fcr 494 at [38] , per madgwick j.
fourthly, the form of the proposed determination complies with s 94a and s 225 of the native title act .
the parties to this proceeding make a similar submission in relation to this case.
