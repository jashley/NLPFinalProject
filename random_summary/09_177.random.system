provision is to be made for the orders which i am about to make to be advertised in appropriate newspapers so that i am satisfied that the making of these orders will come to the attention of any interested person.
if the negotiations are concluded to the satisfaction of both parties, the anz bank may agree to release its security over the equipment.
this places mr reidy in a difficult position because it now appears that there are discussions between the anz bank and aol, the effect of which would be to enable aol to obtain a release from the mortgage debenture, thereby enabling cogl to obtain a clear title to the plant and equipment.
