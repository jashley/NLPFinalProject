there was no request by the plaintiffs to clarify what was meant by the phrase "satisfactory deed of release" as referred to in the offer of compromise.
the evidence does not persuade me that there was any deliberate attempt to misrepresent or mislead as to the position of the defendants, and the notices of appearance and correspondence are not matters that carry such weight as to amount to a ground for refusing to follow the general rule as proscribed by r 11(5).
the response by the plaintiffs on 22 december 2005 was that the offer was defective because it did not comply with o 23 r 4(2).
