i should say that counsel who advanced these contentions in relation to costs on behalf of mr byrnes did not appear at the earlier hearing in relation to the pleadings.
on 4 march 2009, mr byrnes wrote to brisconnections about a proposal to restructure brisconnections.
in light of that observation, the matter was adjourned to enable the respondents to obtain some instructions.
