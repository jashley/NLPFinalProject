(1) subject to this section, a bankrupt who is in receipt of income is entitled to retain it for his own benefit.
the trustee has no interest in seeking a review of that decision.
in any event, it seems clear from reference to the relevant statutory provisions and the case law that, although the expression "property", and cognate expressions such as "the property of the bankrupt" and "after acquired property", are to be construed in a very wide sense, the bankrupt's employment is not considered "property" for the purposes of the bankruptcy act .
