here the question is whether a costs order should be made against the liquidator of jonkay pty ltd (in liq) in an action that was, by leave, brought against the company.
of course if the liquidator is the plaintiff he will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful defendant but has an indemnity for those costs.
moreover, the mortgagee had not assented to the sale and thus was not bound by the contract.
