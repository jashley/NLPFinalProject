i am satisfied that probably several weeks prior to the 18 march meeting, hensley had been apprised by little of the workers compensation issue; he fully understood lancsar's position as to the illegitimacy of the basis upon which bernmar's workforce had been engaged; and he independently had reached his own understanding that bernmar had to be moved toward a "state of legitimacy" in its relations with its workforce.
88 the jda-v negotiations were then reconvened.
we think that we can terminate bernmar's contract for not complying with his legislative obligations.
