as regards these schemes, the meetings have been properly convened, the members have been given adequate information to enable them to make an informed judgment and in voting in favour of the schemes they are acting honestly, as far as i can see.
what other circumstances the court may take into consideration i will not attempt to forecast.
in these circumstances i should not adopt a view of the schemes that is different from the view of the members not unless i could see that something was amiss.
