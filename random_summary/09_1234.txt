the notices to admit facts by notice to admit facts dated 3 april 2009, the applicants sought to require the respondent to admit for the purposes of these proceedings only the facts and matters set out in paragraphs 1 to 20 of that notice.
but, subject to the two exceptions to which i have referred at [21] and [22] above, it seems to me that the notice on its face is otherwise entirely regular and canvasses material which the respondent ought to be able to address, either by way of admission or by way of explanation as to the basis upon which the admissions sought cannot or should not be made.
if there is some genuine and appropriate reason why these matters cannot be admitted, then the respondent should be required to provide that explanation.
