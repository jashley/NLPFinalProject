ms keen had to come to the court in order to have the decision of the tribunal as to the manner in which the review was to be heard under s 69a of the administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth) reviewed.
9 doing the best i can having regard to the fact that ms keen succeeded on one of three grounds, that there was a failed mediation with a registrar of the court and that it was ultimately necessary for ms keen to come to the court to have her right to have a review conducted in accordance with law in the tribunal on the taxation of costs, i think that the appropriate figure to fix so as to avoid any further protracted dispute between the parties as to costs is the sum of $13,500 (see order 4 in keen v telstra corporation limited [2006] fca 834).
' 6 in my opinion it is also appropriate to be used in cases which are simple and in which there would be utility in the court cutting the gordian knot of protracted fights about costs which is the hallmark of this particular piece of litigation.
