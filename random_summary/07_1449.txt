some discussion ensued as to what stage ms bahonko was in administering medication to the resident patients.
as mentioned above, it had power to suspend the registration of a nurse during the conduct of an investigation into his or her professional conduct and to make a determination to place conditions on the registration of a nurse following a formal hearing: see respectively ss 25(1)(a) and 49 (2)(a).
ms bahonko apparently put her keys back in her pocket, sat down, and made some private phone calls.
