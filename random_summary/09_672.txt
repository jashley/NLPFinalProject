no other question is properly raised by mrs vranic's application and she accepts that her complaint is that the tribunal incorrectly approached the application of the notion of "continuous period" to her particular circumstances.
mrs vranic sought review before the social security appeals tribunal (the "ssat") and on 9 september 2008, the ssat affirmed the decision under review.
by ground 2, mrs vranic repeats the contention that the tribunal allowed the respondent to change the name or title of the department after the conclusion of the proceeding before the ssat.
