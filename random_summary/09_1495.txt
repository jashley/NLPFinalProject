the anton piller orders were obtained upon the basis of evidence given by mr christos channa, a disaffected former employee of the tonita respondents.
he said that if mr mendelson provided him with the information that he required on compliance plates, he (mr andrews) would be able to source compliance plates that contained that information from his supply of compliance plates that had come off original machines and that were kept in bins at the botany premises.
mr channa said he had taken the cd from mr allam's car, where mr allam had left it.
