" the federal magistrate did not err when he found that: "by deciding that it was not satisfied that the applicant had an established reputation in the field of sport the tribunal was giving its reason for not being satisfied that there is no reason to believe that the visa applicant does not continue to satisfy the primary criteria for the grant of subclass 421 visa at the time of the tribunal's decision.
subclause 421.222(4) provides: "(4) an applicant meets the requirements of this subclause if: (a) the applicant seeks to enter australia under an arrangement with an organisation in australia to: (i) be a player, coach or instructor in relation to an australian team or organisation; or (ii) participate in a training program; and (b) the applicant is sponsored by an australian citizen, an australian permanent resident, an eligible new zealand citizen or an organisation in australia; and (c) the applicant establishes: (i) if there is a relevant labour agreement between the minister and an australian sporting organisation --- that the sponsorship is in accordance with the agreement; and (ii) that the sponsor has good financial and professional status in australia; and (iii) that the applicant has an established reputation in the field of sport; and (iv) that the applicant and the sponsor have entered into a formal arrangement relating to the applicant's prospective activities in australia; and (d) approval of the application would not result in the number of subclass 421 visas granted in a financial year on the basis of the satisfaction of the requirements of this subclause exceeding the maximum number of such visas specified, by gazette notice, for the purposes of this paragraph in respect of that financial year.
it was not possible for the tribunal to ask and answer the question to be posed by clause 421.230 without determining what was the relevant primary criteria which the appellant continued to satisfy.
