14 pursuant to a deed of settlement approved by this court under s 33v of the federal court of australia act 1976 (cth) on 27 august 2004, caltex agreed to amend its rem model to increase the amount of assistance potentially provided to certain franchisees, including socasen, who require profitability assistance.
7 on 24 may 2007, madgwick j, on the basis of certain undertakings given by paul james simpson, a director of socasen, and his wife, deidre simpson, restrained caltex until 30 june 2007, or further order, from taking further action consequential on the termination notice.
even if i were satisfied that damages will not be an adequate remedy, i would nonetheless refuse the interlocutory relief sought on the basis that the strength of the socasen's case for relief in respect of the notice of termination is insufficiently strong to justify the grant of the relief sought having regard to the practical consequences likely to flow from the order sought.
