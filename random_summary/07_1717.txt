i have considered whether it might be appropriate to take action in this proceeding.
paragraph 1 --- transcript issue 26 i will first deal with that part of paragraph 1 which complains of gordon j's refusal to order that the applicant have access to the whole of the transcript at trial.
to the extent not previously dealt with by the court, the motion of which the applicant gave notice on 4 may 2007 be dismissed.
