cleaners 20 dr sandra lynch gave evidence that the cleaning of the premises at st george's road, was "very unsatisfactory".
when the previous cleaners left, apparently at the applicant's suggestion, a receptionist employed by the respondents to whom the applicant was fairly close, ms cundari, was engaged to clean on saturdays because she wanted the extra money.
the respondents attempted to justify item 5 on the basis that the applicant's conduct amounted in effect to a rejection of dr james lynch's instruction to be diplomatic in her relations with dr chen.
