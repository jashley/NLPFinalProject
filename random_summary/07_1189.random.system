the thing makes me very upset is how can you start legal action against me and why you did not consult me when you or your franchisees got that kinds of letter and you should come and see me instead of starting this legal action.
it is a necessary requirement that an agreement in order to be binding must be sufficiently definite to enable a court to give it a practical meaning.
indeed, as i have previously observed, i am satisfied that the agreement which the parties considered in detail and intended to sign was the longer form of agreement.
