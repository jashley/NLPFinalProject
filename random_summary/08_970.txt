the following exchange then ensued in which the respondents' counsel was put on notice that, in a non-split trial (which was set down to begin some five months later on 21 april 2008), the respondents would be expected to lead evidence with respect to quantum in order to assist le 2003's election between an account of profits and damages in the event it succeeded in establishing liability: mr heerey: your honour, can i just raise one other issue?
the best evidence on this point was the direct testimony of andrews as follows: there came the time --- i think it was '96, correct me if i'm wrong --- where there was no longer a requirement to have a second director.
but neither would assist the respondents' case.
