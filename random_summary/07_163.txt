" 26 in my view, having regard to the nature of the claim and the status of deumer in relation to cosdean and its real interest in the outcome of the proceedings, it is reasonable that the circumstances of deumer should be taken into account on the applications for further security.
in each year its assets included a loan to mr cosenza, unsecured, of about $60,000 and which, as he is bankrupt, must be of dubious value.
it may wish to make its own assessment of cosdean's prospects of success in the proceedings or of the likely award of any damages, and balance those things against the amount of the further security for costs i have ordered.
