in particular, the respondents submitted that the forecasted yield was an assumption made from the fruit that was expected to be produced from a tree in the 2005 crop year for each crop, and was made taking into account: o historical data; o physical inspection of the trees; o current cultural practices; o previous yields; o consideration of the factors such as disease and weather conditions which historically impacted on yield; submissions of the parties 487 the applicants submitted in summary: &#8226; the document yield summary.xls (exhibit a17) was misleading or deceptive because it predicted yields that had never been achieved by the first respondent between 1998 and 2004.
in my view it is likely that mr tracy sifted through the information he had been given, and, on the basis of information as to prices which could be achieved in the market in january, formed a view that he could receive $50 per carton net for 38,000 cartons of lemons, the total of which sum should in the interests of caution be discounted to $1.5 million.
&#8226; the email qualified the forecast by informing mr tracy that yields were budgeted figures and that mr tracy should bear in mind that as per all agricultural practices the forecasts were subject to the weather and timing of picking.
