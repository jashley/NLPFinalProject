the consideration which i find most telling in favour of exercising my discretion to further extend the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice is that the appeal against the cost assessor's determination was instituted on 1 july 2009, over three months before service of the bankruptcy notice.
that motion is listed for hearing today.
on 29 october 2009, a registrar of this court extended time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice to 11 november 2009.
