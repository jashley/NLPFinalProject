however, if the scheme is listed, the responsible entity and its associates are entitled to vote their interest on resolutions to remove the responsible entity and choose a new responsible entity.
the solicitors asserted in paras 38-41 of the letter that: notwithstanding the list of issues we have raised with respect to the disclosure in the explanatory memorandum, both the resolution proposed at the meeting and the voting process are fatally flawed and if the meeting proceeds any resolution adopted will be invalid.
in those circumstances, and given that both matters must be resolved at the same meeting, one would be inclined to think that the responsible entity was sufficiently interested in the replacement to be disqualified from voting on that issue.
