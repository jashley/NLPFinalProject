however, i shall assume in favour of mr nicholls that their alleged decisions (other than that of the magistrate who issued the search warrant) are decisions for which either the afp or the dct are accountable, so that with the exception of the decision to issue the search warrant the impugned decisions can be visited on one or both of the afp and the dct.
here, the complaint is that certain information about the information presented in support of the application for the search warrant was not disclosed, namely that it included information coercively acquired from mr nicholls and which for that reason could not be relied upon by the issuing officer.
mr nicholls should pay the costs of the afp and the dct of the proceeding.
