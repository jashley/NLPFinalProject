the administrators reply that the dct should not be seen as having given up anything by way of compromise in this respect because the cross-claim did not involve any costs over and above the costs involved in the defence of the dct's claim.
26 there would have been some minor additional costs arising from the bringing of the cross-claim, namely, costs relating to the question whether the dct had any actionable duty to the administrators to disclose the information or her intention in respect of an application to have the doca set aside --- an issue which i have not been called upon to resolve.
13 the administrators submit: the dct chose to persevere with its serious criticisms of mr hamilton when the doca had terminated, when it could impact on mr hamilton's reputation and he would have to defend himself, without funds.
