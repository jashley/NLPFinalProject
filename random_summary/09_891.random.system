following international registration of its seahorse shape in benelux, guylian sought protection of the shape mark in australia.
in my view, it is quite possible that as at the priority date other traders might want to depict a seahorse, along with starfish, crabs, prawns for example, in a way that is similar enough to cause potential confusion in the minds of consumers.
(f) in the alternative scenario that the registrar finds that the trade mark is not to any extent inherently adapted to distinguish (subs 41(6)), then the trade mark is taken not to be capable of distinguishing the goods unless the applicant "establishes" that, because of the extent to which the applicant has used the trade mark prior to the relevant filing date of the application, the trade mark does in fact distinguish the goods as being those of the applicant: pars 41(6)(a) and (b).
