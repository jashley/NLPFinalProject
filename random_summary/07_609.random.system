furthermore, if as the appellant claimed she had bribed an official to assist her departure from china, the tribunal did not accept that such bribery was related in any way to falun gong or to any convention related reason.
to grant relief for such an error would be to grant merits review, which is impermissible ( wu shan liang at [272]).
the tribunal, as the primary fact finder, has stated in its findings that it did not believe the appellant to be a falun gong practitioner.
