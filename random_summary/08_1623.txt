plainly, it would be an odd pleading that asserted that anz was a provider of the five content services described at [27] to a potential acquirer of a residential home loan, making enquiries of anz.
presumably, the services in that market include some of the defined loan arrangement services but not others.
by para 4.9, mrpl from february 2003 was accredited by anz through afg to submit loan applications to anz for anz loan products and by para 4.10, in the case of anz loan products, mrpl was paid commission for its loan arrangement services by anz through afg if its customers acquired an anz loan product.
