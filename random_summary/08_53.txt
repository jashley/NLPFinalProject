172 the representation in (d) is not supported by any evidence; it fell, presumably, within mr horton's 'fading memory bank', but in any event its character and standing is no different from the representation alleged in (c) of the 4 july representations as to which see [166] above.
181 in the circumstances, i propose to dismiss the amended cross-claims but without any order as to costs.
in those circumstances, if the applicants had any such expectation of the kind submitted, it had its source or provenance otherwise than in a pleaded representation; perhaps in mr gretton's case, his experience with ricoh for whom he worked for many years and, in mr horton's case, his 'special experience' in franchising.
