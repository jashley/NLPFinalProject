2 the only substantive order sought by the application filed and served by mr carantinos is: an order that the respondent by his servants or agents be restrained from taking any further steps to obtain a sequestration order against the estate of the applicant in proceedings no.
moreover, all of the factors on which mr carantinos wished to rely before this court on seeking the anti-suit injunction can be raised by him in the federal magistrates court in opposing the making of the sequestration order sought by the creditor's petition (s 52(2)(b) of the bankruptcy act ).
in particular, mr carantinos contends, and the respondent disputes, that by reason of the conduct of the respondent, certain dealings between the parties and unfinished litigation in the court of appeal of new south wales, the respondent should be restrained from seeking a sequestration order against mr carantinos's estate.
