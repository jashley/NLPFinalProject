the two certificates related to party and party costs orders which had been made in the district court by delaney dcj on 31 january 2008 and by beazley ja in the new south wales court of appeal on 16 june 2008.
the existence of the costs orders, the assessments and the judgment debt is not in dispute, but the appellant invited the federal magistrates court, and invited this court, to look behind the costs order of delaney dcj so as to find that, in effect, it ought not to have been made because the appellant's substantive claim in the district court should not have been dismissed.
this was addressed by mccoll ja on 13 october 2008 (see miller v nationwide news pty limited [2008] nswca 261).
