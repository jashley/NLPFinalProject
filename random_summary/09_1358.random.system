although not recorded in the aat's decision refusing the extension of time it was (and remains) common ground that the ssat's decision was posted to ms light on 9 june 2009 but she did not receive it, possibly due to an incorrect posting address.
the aat rejected ms light's argument that as her daughter only received the youth allowance from december 2008 it could not be said that she received a social security benefit before that date.
