22 in my opinion the nature of the proceedings is not such as to preclude the court allowing the applicant to adduce his evidence-in-chief in the way in which he proposes.
the presentation of affidavits or witness statements of oral conversations does not disclose the extent to which they have been adduced as a result of leading questions or suggestions put to the deponent.
when the respondents suggest for the first time in their written submissions that there are "very live issues of credit [as to which] the applicant's case will succeed or fail" the applicant submits that it is hard to place much weight on such a statement in view of the absence of even a positive denial of a single fact pleaded against any respondent.
