(2) in my view, the overall savings in cost, by taking the evidence of the cooling off witnesses by video-link rather than having them come here to give their evidence viva voce , will be at best marginal and at worst more expensive.
in each case some of the documents to which the witness will be taken will be original documents.
it will, as submitted by the accc, require the accc to have an agent or agents at the remote location or locations to assist in the identification of documents during the course of cross-examination; it will undoubtedly lengthen the time it takes to complete the cross-examination of the cooling off witnesses --- each day will at best be a half day due to time zone differences --- with attendant increase in the costs incurred for the additional time of counsel and instructing solicitors; and it would be common ground that these latter costs would quickly absorb and overtake any savings as between travel and accommodation costs on the one hand and the direct cost of utilising videoconference facilities on the other.
