this morning i granted leave for mr zabusky to represent the first applicant for the purposes of today's hearing only.
accordingly i make no order in relation to this aspect of the claim.
no evidence has been produced to me that the respondents are in any way at risk of disappearing or dissipating their assets, other than the suspicions of the applicants.
