although i was not directed to any other provision of commonwealth or state legislation, it seems reasonable to expect that it will be a court invested with jurisdiction in respect of commonwealth or state investigation, prosecution or punishment that will have power to issue a criminal justice stay warrant in relation to it --- in the present case a court of the state of new south wales.
the reason is that a criminal justice stay warrant is not "given under" s 151.
the applicant wishes to prosecute that appeal and to tender on the hearing of the appeal expert evidence from a psychologist and from a forensic psychiatrist.
