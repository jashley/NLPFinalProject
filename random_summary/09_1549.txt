i do not think that cl 31.3 of the project 1 trust deed (cl 7.3 of the project 2 constitution ) affects the position.
(2) the apportioned part of any such rent, annuity, or other payment shall be payable or recoverable in the case of a continuing rent, annuity, or other such payment, when the entire portion of which such apportioned part, forms part becomes due and payable, and not before, and in the case of a rent annuity or other such payment determined by re-entry, death, or otherwise, when the next entire portion of the same would have been payable if the same had not so determined, and not before.
this is whether the present fees payable for services to be rendered by the re throughout the year fall within the expression "rents, annuities, dividends, and other periodical payments in the nature of income..." within s 232(1) or are "like interest on money lent" within that provision.
