in so finding i respectfully echo comments of layton j of the industrial court of south australia in glover v tip top bakeries (1984) 8 ir 308 at 313 which comments, although made in the context of sick leave, nonetheless are applicable mutatis mutandis in this context: for such an employee, it would seem quite anomalous if he was to be paid less than his usual entitlement by way of [long service] leave entitlement as though he worked on day work alone.
chapter 2 part 3 of the state act as is clear from cl 7.6 of the psa, the entitlement of a relevant employee to long service leave is as described in ch 2 pt 3 of the state act as amended from time to time.
i do not consider it necessary to dwell further on the issue of application of ch 2 pt 3 of the state act in these circumstances --- the necessity for the court to interpret the relevant provisions of ch 2 pt 3 in relation to the operation of the psa and the application of these provisions in determining the entitlement of relevant employees to long service leave are common ground.
