the tribunal's decision 49 the process of cancellation began with a 'notice of intention to consider cancelling a visa under subsection 501(2) of the migration act 1958 ' dated 1 march 2006, which was sent to the applicant at the correctional centre where he was held at that time.
i accept that submission however i am inclined to the view that the documents were also capable of constituting an inchoate application should an extension of time be granted.
50 it is not in contention that the visa(s) that the applicant held in march 2006 had been granted on 15 october 2001.
