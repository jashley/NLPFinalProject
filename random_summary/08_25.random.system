first, for the reasons i have given, the broader construction of the proportionate liability provisions is not arguable and, secondly, mr michael gargan's proposed defence raises nothing more than what is contained in selected seeds' proposed defence and i do not consider it appropriate to grant leave to defend to more than one cross-respondent.
in those reasons, i refer to the contentions advanced by selected seeds (at [53], [58], [59] and [62]).
as i said in my previous reasons, the liability model was advanced very much as a subsidiary argument and at that time there was, to say the least, little to indicate that any of the cross-respondents were directly liable to the applicants (at [50], [68]).
