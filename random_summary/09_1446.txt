on 7 december 2007, a registrar of the court sent a letter to the parties confirming the direction of the primary judge that they attend a mediation conference, stating it was to be conducted " pursuant to order 72 of the federal court rules ", and giving notice that the mediation conference had been listed at 9.30 am on 22 january 2007 (sic 2008).
on 30 november 2007, the primary judge ordered the parties "to attend, participate in and act reasonably and genuinely in a mediation to be conducted at a time and place to be agreed between the parties".
channel should, therefore, have filed an application under o 52 r 10 for leave to appeal the order and, at the same time, sought an extension of time under o 52 r 10(2a) in which to file that application.
