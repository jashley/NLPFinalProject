mr hunter cannot see the combination of a plurality of springs of alternate winding engaging a non-complex single longitudinal slot and key device, in any of those claims.
the specification identifies the particular features of that spring clutch; the disclosure by ap825 of a bi-directional spring clutch; the method of achieving such functionality; and perceived difficulties with that clutch as a solution to the problem of translating rotational force from one shaft to another in either direction of rotation, by such a spring clutch.
that question is to be answered by determining whether, according to settled principles of construction of the language of the claims in the context of the specification, the phrase "a helical spring according to any one of claims 1 to 12" is confined to a unitary spring of single construction helically wound according to the claims, as uniline contends, or whether claim 13 brings within the monopoly a spring clutch that includes unconnected multiple springs arranged within the clutch according to any one of the helical windings of claims 1 to 12, as sbriggs contends.
