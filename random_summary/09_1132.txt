as the hearing in february 2009 was always intended to deal only with the question of liability, the applicants wished to reserve their position in respect of monetary relief (damages or account of profits).
the applicants go on to allege that, from at least 28 january 2007, csc has, in australia, without the licence of the applicants, communicated the whole or a substantial part of each episode of the twin of brothers series and thus infringed the applicants' copyright in each episode of that series.
this document was entitled consolidated defence to amended statement of claim by the first to fourth respondents .
