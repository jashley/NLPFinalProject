in support of the present application, the applicant filed written submissions dated 2 march 2006, which made extensive criticisms of the original decision of the minister's delegate and thereafter of the tribunal, being submissions which purported to expose a lack of procedural fairness and natural justice.
those orders were made in the context of his honour's conclusion that a certain application filed on 30 august 2005 related to a privative clause decision, and moreover had not been filed within 28 days of the applicants being notified of that decision as required by s 477(1a) of the migration act 1958 (cth).
inevitably his present application necessarily attracted dismissal, accompanied by an order as to costs in the sum of $800.00.
