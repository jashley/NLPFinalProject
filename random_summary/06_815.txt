5 mr mahmoud appeared in person before me on 26 june 2006 at 3.00 pm with a view to seeking an annulment of the sequestration order as a matter of urgency, by reason of pending enforcement by the respondent body corporate of a local court judgment apparently entered in north sydney local court on 1 december 2003 for possession of a certain home unit the subject of strata plan 811.
note: settlement and entry of orders is dealt with in order 36 of the federal court rules .
mr mahmoud did not appear in those proceedings, but subsequently as late as 16 may 2006 he made application to the court for eleven orders, including an annulment of that sequestration order.
