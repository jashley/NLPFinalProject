on the other hand, if the minister's declaration was made without statutory power or authority, i do not consider this uncertainty provides a basis for summarily denying the union the opportunity to make a collateral challenge to its validity.
it follows that what i have to decide at this stage is whether the matter pleaded by the union is so clearly untenable or unarguable that it should be prevented from pursuing that matter at trial.
these processes contrast starkly with those that would undoubtedly have been followed by the minister before issuing the declaration in this matter.
