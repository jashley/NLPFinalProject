the federal magistrate's costs decision 15 i preface my consideration of this matter with the observations that, for present purposes, the award of costs was in his honour's discretion: fm act s 79; and that under r 21.02(2)(a) of the fmc rules an order could be made setting the amount of the costs to be awarded.
his honour rightly chaffed at being asked to engage in a defacto taxation.
he responded that: "my client's offer is that they be dismissed without costs".
