section 3(1) describes the object of the act as being "that any person who carries out construction work ... under a construction contract is entitled to receive, and is able to recover, specified progress payments in relation to the carrying out of that work".
the dispute arises in the following way.
unless its operation is suspended until the contract allows a final claim to be made, the pre-amendment payment act would be given an operation that could hardly have been intended (ie by allowing the claim to be made much earlier than is contemplated under the contract or by allowing a final payment claim to be treated as a progress payment claim).
