when i asked senior counsel for asic why would the solicitor fail to put that material before the court, the response was that he had made "a number of mistakes".
there was nothing which inhibited me from providing instructions about things which i might have known about, but plainly the orders meant that there was nothing that i knew about the conduct of the appeal and upon which i could give instructions.
counsel for asic also submitted that a reasonable person would have understood why senior counsel for asic on 11 september 2007 was being "delphic".
