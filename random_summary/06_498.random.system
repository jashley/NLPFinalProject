1 this is an appeal from the decision of hartnett fm, dismissing an application for review of a decision of the migration review tribunal ('tribunal').
on its face, it was clearly open for the tribunal to make a finding that the academic performance of the applicant was not satisfactory having regard to his high failure rate.
as the tribunal rightly found, these subjects must be taken into account in considering whether the appellant achieved a satisfactory result.
