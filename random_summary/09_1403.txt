the problem is that the lawyer does want to keep in touch with me now, he just refused to have any contacts [sic] with me now... tribunal.
the tribunal concluded that no real information was provided by the appellants regarding these matters because the court case did not exist and they did not have any useful information to provide.
it is just one phone call and i do not think it is difficult for the tribunal, for you to make such a phone call to find out the truth.
