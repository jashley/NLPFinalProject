' 37 in the circumstances of this case it is not suggested that i should depart from the decision of the full court in griffiths and find that raphael fm was without power on 6 june 2008 to order that the orders made by him on 11 july 2007 [sic] be amended by the addition of orders in each matter extending the relevant creditor's petitions up to and including 5 december 2008.
2) [2008] fmca 994 6 exhibit 1 was a form of order made by raphael fm on 10 july 2007 standing the hearing of the creditor's petitions over until 5 march 2008, the parties having liberty to apply on three days' notice.
' 15 whilst no orders were in fact made by the federal magistrate on 11 july 2007, it is common ground that the orders of 6 june 2008 were directed at providing, nunc pro tunc, for an extension of time for the expiry of the creditor's petitions up to and including 5 december 2008, as if those orders had been made on 10 july 2007.
