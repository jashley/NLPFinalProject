i am thus satisfied that the state (via mr marzic) sought legal advice from the parliamentary counsel's office on the second page of document 24 in exhibit cm1.
betfair submitted that to reach this conclusion i would have to be satisfied that the communication into which the legal advice to racing nsw had been incorporated was for the dominant purpose of the state obtaining its own legal advice (citing commissioner of australian federal police v propend finance pty ltd [1997] hca 3 ; (1997) 188 clr 501).
the state submitted that as i was satisfied that the response to the questions on the first page of the email was privileged (see betfair (no 7) at [63]) i should also be satisfied that the questions are privileged; that the client's question incorporates or refers to a communication over which another person may have a privilege does not deprive the client of his or her privilege.
