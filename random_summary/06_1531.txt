i find that mr sadler knew that the statement in the sales document did not disclose the full facts as to the liability for percentage rent, and thereby, created a misleading impression ( yorke v lucas [1985] hca 65 ; (1985) 158 clr 661).
he said that during the meal mr stubberfield asked him whether he had ever had to pay extra rent under, what mr sadler referred to as, the 'turnover rent clause'.
he said that for the financial year ending 30 june 2002, the applicant should have bought two new machines for the carousel store and one new machine for the galleria store.
