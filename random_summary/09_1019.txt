apotex points to the evidence of dr kennedy in support of this contention.
(2) an amendment of a complete specification is not allowable after the relevant time if, as a result of the amendment: (a) a claim of the specification would not in substance fall within the scope of the claims of the specification before amendment; or (b) the specification would not comply with subsection 40(2) or (3).
his lordship then dealt with the questions of novelty and obviousness of the claimed invention and comprehensively dismissed the appeal as being "without merit" on the basis that claim 1 and the process claim lacked novelty.
