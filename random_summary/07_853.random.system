it seemed to me that there was more than simply the case of the second respondent in issue between the parties, and that the award and the certified agreement as they then stood may not cover the dispute that really divided the parties.
these are the provisions of the wr act under which relief was sought in the present case.
by email communication dated 9 may 2000, the senior instructor at the training college at fiskville informed the second respondent that she did not hold the qualification of qualified firefighter, that she was considered to be an instructor who had undertaken a course of training and attained assessment as a leading firefighter, that this did not amount to a promotion, and that she was still regarded as an instructor with qualifications as a leading firefighter.
