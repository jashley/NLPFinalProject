in dranichnikov , the tribunal had not considered a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts, that being whether the applicant was a member of a particular social group consisting of entrepreneurs and businessmen who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crime or criminals (at 394 [24] per gummow and callinan jj).
the tribunal had in fact considered another question which was whether the applicant's membership of a social group being "businessmen in russia" was a reason for persecution and relevantly nothing more.
i have heard submissions and i think that it is appropriate to grant leave to amend.
