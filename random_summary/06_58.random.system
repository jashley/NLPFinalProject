21 in respect of the permanent impairment claim, the tribunal made two relevant findings: at [94]: 'the tribunal was satisfied in relation to mr riddle's back pain, that there was only a temporal, and no causal connection with the employment, and that any permanent impairment suffered on 19 february 2003 was therefore not compensable.
' 35 in comcare v hill (1999) 56 ald 487, spender j --- in particular at [9] --- endorsed the approach of sackville j.
this is particularised in the following way: the tribunal found the following: (i) that dr griffith and dr wong were of the opinion that the work place was implicated in the applicant's present condition [99]; (ii) that dr dalton concluded that the nature and conditions of the applicant's employment involved physical activities which quite reasonably could have aggravated the underlying degenerative condition [99]; (iii) that dr griffith also opined that he agreed with dr dalton that had the applicant's employment been office based he would have been less likely to have suffered a disc lesion as an aggravation to the degenerative changes in the applicant's spine [100]; the tribunal then went on at [101] to decide that it was satisfied from the medical evidence, which it had discussed in [99] and [100], that the impairment of the applicant was not attributable to the nature and conditions of the applicant's employment and at [102] that the tribunal was not satisfied that the available evidence established an entitlement to compensation on the basis of the nature and conditions of the applicant's employment with the respondent.
