in addition, a number of natural persons were alleged to have been involved in the contraventions.
it appears to me that there were mistakes on both sides in relation to the agreements.
there are some respondents who entered into agreements with the accc during the course of the proceeding, prior to its trial, which agreements obliged those respondents to make full admissions as to contraventions of s 45(2) of the trade practices act , to consent to orders being made against them, including orders for pecuniary penalties, declarations and injunctions, in some cases to give evidence on behalf of the accc at the trial, and to submit to orders that they pay costs to the accc.
