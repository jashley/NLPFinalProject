mr mcdonald will be fully compensated by the order made on 2 october 2007 in the primary reasons; (7) the court cannot be influenced by any concern to reimburse the applicant or mr mcdonald for costs incurred in prosecuting the application: victoria university of technology v australian education union (1999) 91 ir 96 at [34]; (8) finally, although a penalty acts as a general deterrence, such deterrence is relevant where the obligations are clear, even if the employer was ignorant of the obligation.
accordingly, any penalty would be determined by reference to the "totality principle": cpsu, the community and public sector union v telstra corporation limited (2001) 108 ir 228.
these reasons for decision should be read with the primary reasons.
