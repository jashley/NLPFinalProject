paragraph [14] does not disclose information specifically in relation to any of boyce's projects or pieces of work.
17 paragraphs [15] and [18]-[23] of the report concern steps taken, or steps to be taken, by boyce to remove from its current and future publications information, data and diagrams which were included in previous versions of its publications which infringed autodata's copyright, and to cease supplying versions of its publications which include that infringing information.
counsel for autodata made the point, which i accept, that where information is published in one publication but then removed from a subsequent version of the publication, then neither the information removed nor the fact of its removal can be confidential because such information is already in the public domain by virtue of the existence of the previous publication.
