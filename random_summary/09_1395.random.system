mr rafeletos accepts that the document that daniella says she prepared is consistent with his financial position at that time, save for a reference to a loan to great wall in the sum of $200,000, financed by st george bank, as an asset of mr rafeletos.
i shall return to that matter later.
it is clear that mr capocchiano and great wall have repudiated that contract, such that it would be open to mr rafeletos to terminate the contract and sue for damages for its breach.
