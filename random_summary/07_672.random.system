i am not persuaded that any basis has been advanced on behalf of the commission for waiver of the requirement to comply with order 37 rule 2(3).
notwithstanding that, in my reasons of 20 december 2006, i concluded that the defendant should be found guilty of a charge of contempt for failing to provide all reasonable assistance to the commission at a hearing on 3 february 2006, i do not consider, on reflection, that the defendant should be punished separately for any failure to provide reasonable assistance on that occasion.
as i have said, failure to comply with an order of the court is a very serious matter.
