(revised from the transcript) 1 this matter was in my list for callover today.
6 in all the circumstances i am of the opinion that it is an appropriate exercise of power under s 25(2b)(bb)(ii) of the act to order that the appeal be dismissed for the failure of the appellant to attend the callover today.
