the applicants say the real reason why mr cunningham was suspended on 8 july 2008 was because the m3fs compliance committee then believed, on the basis of an incorrect electronic file notation made by mr nguyen in respect of his visit to the offices of avoca on 15 january 2008, but not actually made and entered in the m3fs myworkspace computer system until 4 july 2008, that the applicants had not made any client files available for pre-vetting by m3fs as required by the december action plan.
mr nguyen says he then asked benita if melvyn gyi was in and he met with him.
from about the middle of february to early march he was on annual leave.
