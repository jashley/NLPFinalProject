the written submission asserts that he did not have the opportunity to fully explain to the federal magistrate why the tribunal erred in that regard because the appellant was told that what he was putting went to the merits of the case and would not show jurisdictional error.

it also asserts a denial of natural justice because, it is claimed, the appellant "lost the chance for oral evidence before the federal magistrate".
