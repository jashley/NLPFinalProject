on 5 may 2009 ms bishop was contacted by mr and mrs osler, informing her that they had booked and paid for tours with the applicant for july 2009.
whether the respondents could not or would not wish to benefit from hfat's bookings is irrelevant.
the end result is that the "list of bookings" to which ms bishop referred in her affidavit at para 30, and which mr rhys thomas was alleged to have offered ms chaloner, appears illusory.
