in this case, mr spalla's conduct during the first four days of the trial meant that much of these four days were effectively wasted.
&#8226; on the fourth day (17 march 2006), the morning was occupied in dealing with mr. o'connor's retainer and the withdrawal of the applicant's solicitor's retainer.
this submission requires that some consideration be given to what happened during these first four days.
