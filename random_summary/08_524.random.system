25 prior to reaching its decision the tribunal sent to the appellant a letter dated 9 august 2006 in which attention was drawn to and comment invited upon there being little substantive evidence in 2002 of a then continuing relationship, to the notes of field visits (copies of which were enclosed) to the claimed matrimonial residence which it was said raised doubts as to whether the appellant and his wife resided together or were in a spousal relationship, to the appellant's inconsistencies in response at interview as mentioned in the ministerial delegate's reasons, to an absence of spousal identification on tax returns, to the appellant's having bills sent to his aunt's address, to his wife's having purchased a house in her own name and to the appellant's residing regularly at his aunt's house.
in these circumstances, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to consider, in relation to the validity of the tribunal's decision or the granting of relief, what might be the ramification in light of the later events which have transpired from the appellant's attendance at the hearing before the tribunal up to and including his belated reference to s 360a before this court, of any non-compliance with the terms of that section.
the tribunal is not obliged "to give a line by line refutation of the evidence for the claimant either generally or in those respects where there is evidence that is contrary to findings of material fact made by the tribunal": re minister for immigration and multicultural affairs; ex parte durairajasingham [2000] hca 1 ; (2000) 74 aljr 405 at 416, [65] .
