&#8226; the usher of the black rod indicated when inviting the respondent's response to mr curtis' report that she had an open mind on the issue of (a) whether the alleged breaches were made out, and, (b) whether any sanction would be imposed.
there was nothing to establish special circumstances existing before or after mr curtis so indicated to warrant any other view: there was no question of confidential policy advice at a high level the disclosure of which might jeopardise future frankness, no question of protecting any witness from a real risk of retribution, nor any other kind of circumstance which could justify a limitation on disclosure of adverse material to a party undergoing disciplinary investigation.
if the investigator finds that a breach has occurred, he or she may also recommend an appropriate sanction.
