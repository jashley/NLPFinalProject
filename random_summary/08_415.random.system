there is an issue arising out of these payments and i will refer to that below.
i have evidence before me from the national australia bank that the company was in default under the terms and conditions of the overdraft facility by reason of the appointment of a liquidator to the company.
3 there is evidence before me in an affidavit of the liquidator, mr richard campbell brien, sworn 25 february 2008, that the company has a very substantial surplus of assets over liabilities, based upon the information available to the liquidator as to the realizable value of the company's assets.
