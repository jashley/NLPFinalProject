in that case, at [16] french j said: if the original authority conferred upon an applicant for the purpose of making and dealing with matters in relation to a native title determination is subject to the continuing supervision and direction of the native title claim group, then it may be that an applicant whose authority is so limited is not authorised to act inconsistently with a resolution or direction of the claim group.
the following exchange then took place: mr levy: in relation to this matter is there any requirement, to your knowledge, under aboriginal tradition, that when a number of groups make a decision, for example, the kamu, warai and wagiman groups for the douglas north application, is there any requirement under aboriginal tradition that a decision can only be made if those groups actually meet in person collectively and together?
the persons making the application under s 66b are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising under it.
