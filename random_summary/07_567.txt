in my view the proceeding cannot be dismissed for want of prosecution in the circumstances.
the applicant says affidavits have been sworn on the applicant's behalf to the effect that the discovered documents do not exist, so that is the end of the matter.
further the applicant says that although it wishes to make some amendments to the statement of claim and subject to orders being made in relation to consequential amendments, directions for trial may now be made.
