in particular, s 459c(2) provides that the court must presume that a company is insolvent if during or after the three months ending on the day when the application was made, a receiver, or receiver and manager, of property of the company was appointed under a power contained in an instrument relating to a floating charge on such property (s 459c(2)(c)).
a presumption for which s 459c provides operates except so far as the contrary is proved for the purposes of the application (s 459c(3)).
