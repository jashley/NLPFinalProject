8 in july 2004 the business was restructured and, according to the plaintiff, was thereafter primarily operated by the first defendant.
they submitted that what he was saying, in effect, was that he had a suspicion that there had been a misrepresentation as to the true value of his interest in the defendant companies and he wanted to have a look at the books of the defendants to see whether he might issue proceedings in the family court, but there was no certainty that he would.
the plaintiff says that by reason of facts that have come to his notice since 30 august 2006, that belief is wrong and that the only explanation for the error is that ms asciak, who was in control of the defendants' accountants, must have withheld relevant information from him.
