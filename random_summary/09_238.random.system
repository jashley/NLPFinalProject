the application is late and is against an order made in the exercise of the court's discretion in a matter of practice and procedure.
i directed that the application be returned on 3 march 2009.
... the convenience of the parties is of course a significant matter and i accept if there is substance in the grounds advanced by the applicant as explaining her departure for melbourne so soon after the application was filed in the adelaide registry --- if there is indeed substance in those matters --- the balance of convenience may well lie with her.
