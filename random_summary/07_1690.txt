further, i am of the view that there is a serious question to be tried that, by stipulating for the payment of the risk fees, which on occasions exceeded the amount of the loan by more than 100%, the first respondent engaged in unconscionable conduct in contravention of s 12cc of the act.
i accept there is a serious question to be tried that such disaggregation had to occur on the proper construction of s 12cc(8) and s 12cc(10) of the act.
on the applicant's best case, the amount is approximately $8 million.
