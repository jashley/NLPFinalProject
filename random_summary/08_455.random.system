here there is a strong case for the displacement of the plaintiffs' equitable interest by reason of them: (1) having entered into the securities lending and borrowing agreement, by which they represented that they have no interest in shares lent to op securities; (2) having allowed op securities to become the legal owner of the shares; and, perhaps (3) having contemplated that their shares might be "lent" to a third party.
accordingly this would be a significant encroachment on the "beneficial ownership" which the plaintiffs assert.
rectification also is a "mere equity" that would not defeat a later equitable interest.
