the first respondent's counsel referred to decisions in the high court to the effect that the tribunal must strictly comply with s 424a (see saap v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] hca 24 ; (2005) 215 alr 162).
i do note, however, that the high court's ruling in saap makes it clear that any information required under s 424a must be given to an applicant in writing : see saap v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] hca 24 ; (2005) 215 alr 162 at 183 per mchugh j; at 196 per gummow j; at 205 per hayne j.
12 since i have determined that the "information" in question all qualifies under the statutory exemption in s 424a(3) , it is not necessary to examine the specifics of whether and how the information was relayed to the appellant.
