51 i set out at [16] above the orders that were made on 11 april 2006.
accordingly, even though the petition lapsed at midnight between 25 and 26 april 2006, it remained possible for the court on 26 april 2006 to make an order under s 52(5) extending the period at the expiration of which the petition would lapse.
... having decided that i should await the decision of the high court and then having decided that i should receive written submissions on the significance of the high court's judgment within the period specified in the order, i am certain that if i had adverted to the issue at the time i would have extended the life of the petition on 11 april 2006.
