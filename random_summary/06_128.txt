some juridical support in principle for saga's contention as to the order for costs sought by saga may be found in the following authorities to which my attention has been drawn: (i) commissioner of taxation v b &amp; g plant hire pty ltd (1994) 123 alr 699 at 709 per gummow j.
5 of course every area of such authority must ultimately be appraised in relation to its own circumstances.
4 in my opinion the litigation raised important and difficult fiscal issues in particular on the construction of the legislation, and i am unable to acknowledge the commissioner's characterisation of the litigation as 'very much private litigation and not litigation in the public interest'.
