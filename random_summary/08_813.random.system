having regard to mr snell's affidavit, i am satisfied that an amount of $2,700.00 properly represents a discounted amount of the party and party costs the first respondent might otherwise be entitled to recover upon taxation.
the application is supported by an affidavit of mr peter snell a solicitor employed by sparke helmore lawyers, the solicitors for the first respondent.
