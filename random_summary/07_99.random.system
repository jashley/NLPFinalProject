buchanan j: 1 this matter concerns an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from the administrative appeals tribunal ('the aat').
5 ms dinnen who appeared for the respondent before me today, however, in opposing the application for extension of time, drew my attention to a judgment of wilcox j in hunter valley developments pty ltd v cohen (1984) 3 fcr 344.
six matters were referred to by his honour, including the necessity to be satisfied that it is proper to grant the application, whether an acceptable explanation for the delay has been furnished, whether any prejudice will be occasioned to the respondent and consideration of fairness.
