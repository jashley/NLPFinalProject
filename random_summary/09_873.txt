i certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice collier.
in my view there should be no order in respect of costs for or against the second respondent: new south wales dairy corporation v murray-goulburn co-operative company limited (1989) 14 ipr 75 at [80].
in my view the respondents are entitled to their costs of an interlocutory application filed 18 january 2007, in which they successfully sought an order that deloitte touche tohmatsu make discovery of all documents in its possession relating to the financial affairs of the second applicant for the years ending 31 december 1997, 1998 and 1999 ( forbes engineering (asia) pte limited v forbes [2007] fca 67).
