in the present case, there is clear evidence that ms menassa intended to apply on 11 april 2006 for an order under s 52(5) of the bankruptcy act but forgot to do so and a clear statement by driver fm in his honour's reasons for judgment that he would have made such an order if he had appreciated that the creditor's petition was to lapse on 25 april 2006.
accordingly, even though the petition lapsed at midnight between 25 and 26 april 2006, it remained possible for the court on 26 april 2006 to make an order under s 52(5) extending the period at the expiration of which the petition would lapse.
29 driver fm considered that if the power to extend the life of the petition was available to him, it should be exercised.
