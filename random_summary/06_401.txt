merits of the appeal making of the sequestration order 32 as pointed out by the full court in heinrich v commonwealth bank of australia (2003) fcafc 315 at par 20, 'the court must first consider whether the sequestration order ought not to have been made.
if it so finds, then the court must consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy should be annulled... later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made.
36 in my view, the applicant has not established a prima facie case that she was solvent at the date of the sequestration order upon which her bankruptcy is founded.
