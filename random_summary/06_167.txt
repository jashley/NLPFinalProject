a delegate of the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs (subsequently, the minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs, now again the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs) (in all cases, 'the minister') refused to grant a protection visa.
21 it does seem to me that, if the appellant could have made a case that he had a ground on which he could have sought to set aside the tribunal's decision, which was a ground not available to him under the provisions of pt 8 of the migration act , as they stood at the time of his application to this court that was dealt with by north j, then he might still have been able to make an application to set aside the decision of the tribunal at the time when he made his first application to the federal magistrates court, and even at the time when he made his second.
on 6 april 2005 the federal magistrates court dismissed that proceeding.
