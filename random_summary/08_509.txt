12 the question, therefore, is whether it was necessary for ms richards to have made the originating application for the relief claimed by her.
3 however, in purporting to amend the records of the company, on 4 september 2007, mr armenti in error removed ms richard's name as sole shareholder and director of the company and substituted the name of ms arnold as the sole shareholder and director of the company.
23 it is the case, as contended by ms arnold, that the correspondence sent by ms richards' solicitors before the commencement of the federal court proceeding, does not disclose that mr armenti had on 29 january 2008 already made an amendment to the register, as he put it, in "anticipation of ms shelley arnold agreeing" to the amendment, so that the register showed that ms richards held a 95% shareholding and ms arnold held a 5% shareholding.
