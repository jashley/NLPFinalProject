in my opinion, the authorities establish that where a foreign defendant counterclaims or cross-claims, it will be ordered to provide security for costs if, in substance, what it puts forward is not simply a defence to the claim, but a distinct claim in itself, provided that on an overall assessment by the court it is just and fair that such an order be made.
there is substance in elbow river's contention that some additional costs will be incurred because of national biofuels' claim.
in those circumstances, it contends that it should not be required to provide security.
