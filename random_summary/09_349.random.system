mr lombe has set out in his affidavit the opinion that an extension of the convening period for four months is justified and that it is in the interests of creditors of bbl.
it was these trigger events and the inability of bbl to meet the next scheduled interest payment to noteholders which resulted in the appointment of the administrators.
the application is supported by an affidavit of mr david john frank lombe who is one of the administrators of bbl.
