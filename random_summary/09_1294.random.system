the administrator appointed under the scheme approved by the court, mr john vines, has been concerned to ensure that the resources of the union were not used to support the election campaigns of any candidates.
it will not be so satisfied if the grounds relied upon could not, even if made out, constitute "an irregularity in relation to an election for an office in the organisation".
