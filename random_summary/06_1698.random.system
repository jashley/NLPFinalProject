it is not the timber (or the wood and bark from the timber) which the patent protects but the process by which the wood and bark from the timber is used so as to result in the product, namely blue cypress oil.
the tender documents do not suggest any actual awareness of the process, or of the elements or components required to produce blue cypress oil.
no doubt in the light of those definitions, the collins acknowledged that the timber, until it was "written off", was a staple commercial product.
