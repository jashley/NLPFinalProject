a conclusion which goes no further than that the grounds of appeal appear weak or unlikely to succeed will not ordinarily lead to a refusal to extend the time within which to appeal where the other factors suggest an extension of time should be granted.
i have read the primary judge's reasons for finding the applicant guilty of contempt, the proposed grounds of appeal and the outline of submissions filed by the respondent.
however, i cannot reach the conclusion that the proposed appeal has no prospect of success without hearing a good deal more from the parties, and any further hearing would approximate the hearing of the appeal itself.
