whether such an order should be made is for the discretion of the court in each case.
that judgment was set aside on appeal but not because of any fault in the relief granted ( leda holdings pty ltd v oraka pty ltd (1998) atpr 41-601).
it seems to me that an order based upon the quantified claims is appropriate.
