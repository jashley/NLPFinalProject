however, the weight to be given to that consideration is also limited by the fact that, by reason of the position adopted by the university, the applicant was required to commence this proceeding with the attendant surrender of confidentiality associated with the commencement of a proceeding in this court.
the university went on to plead that it would consent to orders in the following or substantially similar terms: '(a) in the events that have occurred, the misconduct investigation committee purportedly established by the respondent in or about early february 2006 to consider, investigate and make determinations in respect of allegations of misconduct against the respondent [sic] ("the committee") was invalidly constituted and its deliberations and determinations are void and of no effect; and (b) the respondent be permanently restrained from: (i) proceeding further with any hearings or deliberations of the committee; and (ii) giving effect to any deliberation or determination of the committee in respect of allegations of misconduct against the applicant.
14.2 the academic member of executive shall consider any matter raised by the employee with him/her and the report of the misconduct investigation committee or the investigating officer before making a final determination as to whether misconduct/serious misconduct has occurred.
