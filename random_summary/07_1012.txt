thus, on the transfer date cihl's policies will be transferred from sf1 (with net assets of $94 million as at 31 december 2006) to a significantly larger and more diverse portfolio of business of cmla's sf3 (net assets of $1,657 million as at 31 december 2006).
(9) that an approved summary of the scheme has been given to every affected policy owner other than those in respect of whom dispensation with a need for compliance with subs 191(2)(c) of the act was given by the court on 7 june 2007, namely: (i) those policyholders of cihl for whom cihl has no record of a current address (being three policyholders); and (ii) those policyholders of cmla whose policies are referrable to cmla's sf3.
to this end, on the transfer date, cmla will acquire all assets and assume all liabilities of cihl's sf1, other than current tax liabilities of sf1 to 30 june 2007 and an amount represented by the provisions set aside to meet such liabilities.
