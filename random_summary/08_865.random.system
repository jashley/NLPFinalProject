37 in my view, the appropriate order is that the trial dates should be vacated, and that the applicant is to bear the costs of the respondent thrown away by vacation of the trial dates subject to an undertaking in a form acceptable to the respondent.
further, although mr peden contended on 4 june 2008 that the normal rule applies and the applicant would be entitled to its costs if successful on its amended notice of motion, other than this limited submission counsel have not made submissions specific to these costs to date.
