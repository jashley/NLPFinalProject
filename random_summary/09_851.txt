notwithstanding the fact that the present applicant is not legally represented, some assistance has obviously been obtained in respect to the drafting of the application for leave to appeal .
considerations relevant when deciding whether leave to appeal should be granted are: whether in all the circumstances the judgment of the primary judge is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the full court; and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision were wrong.
here no explanation was provided in the affidavit filed in support of the application .
