it was that restoration attempt that has led to the filing of the dismissal motion.
given the drastic step involved in terminating a proceeding, and in order to provide an opportunity to the narnoobinya applicants to give serious consideration to the tasks which confront them, i consider it fair and just to make a self-executing order in the following terms: unless by 11 december 2009 the narnoobinya applicants file and serve a document setting out precisely what steps they intend to take in their proceeding and a reasonable time frame for carrying out such steps, their application stands dismissed.
the narnoobinya applicants filed their application on 4 june 1997 but have not taken any steps to file evidentiary material or points of claim or in any other way sought to progress their claim in the court, although they have been involved in mediation conducted in the native title tribunal.
