the wafc confirmed this outcome in a letter dated 18 april 2008 sent to the sfc.
the letter stated expressly, if it were necessary, that csa's entitlement to market or sell hospitality functions packaged for rugby test match tickets and its rights to associate with aru was at an end.
i do not think it likely that the purpose was, as csa contends, to "lock-out" csa from supplying corporate hospitality at the perth test match.
