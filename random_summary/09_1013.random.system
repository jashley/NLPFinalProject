had they been any longer, the submission made on behalf of burnett water that, with the best of will, recollection can fade and evidence is best received when a view is fresh would have resonated greatly with me.
when one has regard to what i have referred to as the asymmetry of role whereby the conservation council has no control over conditions but has an ability to litigate nonetheless, it does seem to me that, as a matter of courtesy, it would have been better if burnett water had been rather more fulsome in its disclosure of its intentions.
it would be quite wrong, a subversion of the separation of powers under our constitution , for me, in any way, to speculate as to how the minister might come to make his decision.
