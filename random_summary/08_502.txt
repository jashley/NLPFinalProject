on 5 august 2005 a delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa.
the appellant's counsel submitted that the issue that was not put to the appellant in accordance with s 425(1) was that there were conflicting statements in the amnesty international report about whether rajendra dhakal had been arrested or was in police custody.
he said if mr rajendra has disappeared or is dead then his followers will be angry with him.
