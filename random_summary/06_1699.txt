38 i am mindful that one must read the tribunal's decision fairly, bearing in mind that they are the reasons of an administrative decision-maker: see minister for immigration and ethnic affairs v wu shan liang [1996] hca 6 ; (1996) 185 clr 259 at 271-272 and the authorities referred to.
as is evident from the tribunal's reasoning however, these instances of non-compliance were not relied upon as a ground for cancellation, but were matters taken into account in the exercise of the discretion to cancel the visa pursuant to par 109(1).
