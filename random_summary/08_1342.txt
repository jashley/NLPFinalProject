27 it seems to me that on a consideration of the statement of decision and reasons of the tribunal in this case and in the context of the principles enunciated above, a failure by the tribunal as constituted by mr delofski to properly address s 65(1) has been disclosed.
the tribunal latched on to an 'admission' that the appellant 'did not have a leadership or preaching role in her religious activities'.
the appellant claimed that to secure her release from detention, she made payments of rmb 1000 yuan, 3000 yuan and 10,000 yuan (see paragraphs 4, 5 and 9).
