the high court said that the test requires the court to have regard to the legal, rather than the practical effect of the judgment on its face: see per gibbs cj at 248 and mason j at 253 to 256.
in re luck the high court held that an order dismissing an action because it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action was an interlocutory order.
the latter case was the kind discussed in tampion and re luck, but, as the judgment in anshun [no 1] makes clear, tampion and therefore re luck do not concern the former kind of case, with which we are concerned here.
