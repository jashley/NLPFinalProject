the taxpayer applicants asserted moreover that the court's power to strike out is discretionary in its exercise, and is to be undertaken with 'great caution', citing effem foods pty ltd v trawl industries of australia pty limited (1993) 43 fcr 510 at 532 (per burchett j as a member of a full court), where his honour was speaking of the exercise of 'discretion to stay proceedings as an abuse of the process of the court, whether on the ground of [ res judicata ] or on any other ground'.
the functions of that former board of review constituting 'a part of the process of assessment...' and having a ' limited jurisdiction ' as above described, were not readily comparable to the exercise of the jurisdiction presently undertaken at first instance by a court of record, such as the federal court or a supreme court of a state or territory in australia, in at least an income tax appeal.
