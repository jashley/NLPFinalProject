there is, in my view, no relevant fettering of discretion --- the company itself will enter into the contract and the members will consider the issue of change of name when it arises.
if the company wishes to change its name, it is abundantly clear that it must pass a special resolution adopting a new name.
there is the promotion of the game of golf, and the provision of links and grounds at torquay, which do not necessarily need to involve the ownership of the land.
