5 mr chamberlain also considers that if he were required to report to creditors by 15 january 2009 on their various options, he would not be in a position to adequately address the options for amalgamation and would not be able to make a recommendation to creditors of the club as to what would be in their best interests.
1 on 11 december 2008, emmett j made an order pursuant to s 439a(6) of the corporations act 2001 (cth) that the convening period for the convening of a meeting of creditors of south wagga sports and bowling club ltd (administrator appointed) ( the club ) under s 439a of the act be extended to 15 january 2009.
his honour there observed that the function of the court on an application under s 439a is to strike an appropriate balance between the expectation that the administration would be a relatively speedy and summary matter, and the requirement that undue speed should not be allowed to prejudice sensible and constructive actions directed towards maximising the return for creditors and any return for shareholders.
