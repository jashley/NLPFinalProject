the notice of appeal included the following grounds: the tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations and evidence; the tribunal denied the appellant procedural fairness by failing to provide the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to respond to country information; the tribunal failed to investigate the provenance of the letter from the dum dum trinamool yuba congress, faxed on the 29 november 2003; the tribunal made findings which were not open on the evidence; and that the tribunal erred in finding that the appellant could avoid harm if he ceased to be involved in politics in india.
18 in the appellant's written submissions, he also contended that the tribunal failed to consider whether relocation was reasonable, since the police could still find him anywhere in india in relation to the alleged false charges.
the appellant claimed to have been involved in various executive positions and election campaigns, culminating in his being appointed as the youth secretary of one of the tmc's district committees in mid-2002.
