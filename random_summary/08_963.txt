2 on 23 october 2007, the australian securities and investments commission (asic) decided that each action should be "carried on" by it in the name of the plaintiff.
the legislative history demonstrates that the reason the separation occurred was to distinguish between corporate persons, where consent would not be required for asic to bring an action, and natural persons, where consent would be required.
while i accept that the provisions arise in somewhat different contexts, their topic is asic's ability to play a role in a claim made, or that could be made, by others.
