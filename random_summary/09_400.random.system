he said: on or about 3 april 2008, i instructed jws [johnson winter &amp; slattery, hardel and avpri's solicitors] to write to simmons &amp; mccartney [cbh's and alpha's solicitors] and inform them that we were aware that winding up applications had been filed, but had not been served, and that such winding up applications were themselves based upon statutory demands that had not been served.
i note that although an unsigned statutory demand has now been received by avpri and hardel, in the form attached to the originating process in actions numbered nsd 424 of 2008 and nsd 425 of 2008, no statutory demand has been received at all that is signed and accompanied by a sworn affidavit.
however, hardel and avpri brought this proceeding in case such a suggestion was made.
