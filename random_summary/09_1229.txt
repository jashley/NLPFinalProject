senior counsel for sirtex note that dr gray's new evidence purports to describe the content of an oral discussion at a meeting in january 1997 (over 12 and a half years ago) between dr gray and mr lennon.
[16] additionally, he would not have wanted uwa on the share register of sirtex by reason of animosity between himself and the vice chancellor and provost of uwa.
it is not good enough, in the event, for counsel for dr gray to say that, if dr gray were permitted to lead this evidence, it would be a "cross-examiner's dream" for counsel for sirtex.
