8 it is perhaps curious that there should be a claim which alleges a primary liability under the tpa on the part of the individuals as well as on the part of the company of which they are directors.
the claim against the individual is based on a contravention of the fta, whereas the claim against the company for a contravention of the tpa and/or the fta is based on the attribution of the individual's acts to the company.
