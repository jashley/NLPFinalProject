6 parliament has made clear that in proceedings under the wr act, costs should be awarded only when costs have been incurred as a result of an unreasonable act or omission.
in our view, neither the late abandonment of some of its defence, nor the use of a notice of contention to advance a previously minor and ultimately unsuccessful argument, crosses the threshold of being "an unreasonable act or omission" for the purposes of s 824(2).
that order operated as a conditional stay of execution of the judgment.
