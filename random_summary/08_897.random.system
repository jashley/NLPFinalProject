43 .there are, however, in my opinion, two pleading defects which masu has identified.
it is surely not intended to assert that the pds given to, say, mr stoyef would have referred to "each of the westpoint products".
mr stoyef pleads in para 42a (referred to at [22] above) that a pds in the present case would have referred at least to the fact that each of the westpoint products was a managed investment scheme required to be registered with asic but not registered with it and therefore liable to be wound up, and in para 43 (referred to at [23] above) that he and the group members, if they had been given such a pds, would not have invested in the westpoint products.
