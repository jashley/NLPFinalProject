the terms of clause 5a407, read sensibly, require the test to have been taken within a period from two years before the date of the application and the date of the application itself.
at the hearing in the federal magistrates court, the appellant sought to tender two documents: (1) an ielts test report form of a test apparently conducted on 17 january 2009; and (2) a letter dated 28 may 2009 from medibank private, confirming that the appellant had health cover from 24 september 2008 to 24 march 2010.
the importance of this material was evident from the tribunal's letter and had been discussed with the appellant at the hearing.
