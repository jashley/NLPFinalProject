it may well be open to the applicants to refer to the matters pleaded in paras 117(c)(i), 117(c)(ii) and 117(c)(iv), in particulars of a plea that the representation was false, on the basis that they support an inference to that effect; but, in my view, the pleading of the facts in those three paragraphs, as currently pleaded, does not make up for the failure to plead the 'falsity' case, clearly and directly.
by that pleading, the respondents have been properly informed of the case that they have to meet at trial on the causal link between loss and breach.
insofar as there may be a need for further particularity, this can be done by a request for further and better particulars.
