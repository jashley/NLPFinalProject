40 in my opinion, the rrt's finding that the behaviour, which the first appellant attributed to jahangir in her claims and which bore no resemblance to the "cunning and ruthless" behaviour ascribed to him in independent reports, was not "information" of a kind that had to be provided in writing pursuant to s 424a(1).
then, just a few days later, jahangir reduced the ransom by 90% for no apparent reason.
the reference to "independent reports", in context, was not intended to suggest that jahangir's reputation for being "cunning and ruthless" came solely from those reports.
