in this case the tribunal noted that it would ordinarily examine the degree to which each prescribed impairment diminished the capacity of mr house to undertake each of the relevant kinds of employment, but that in the circumstances it would be artificial to endeavour to determine the effect of each prescribed impairment (at [116]-[117]).
of course, his honour might have concluded that this course was not appropriate in the circumstances; but it was a matter of discretion and his honour's reasons lead us to conclude that he did not see himself as having such discretion.
