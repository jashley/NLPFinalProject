i do not consider that the reliance on the misrepresentations pleaded in the present proceedings is a factor which makes these actions "stand-alone" proceedings.
there is also an overlap with the issues raised in the auditor action.
this is because the administrators have stated unequivocally that no further dividend will be paid to creditors until after the determination of the shareholder action and the auditor action.
