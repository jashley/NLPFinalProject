background on 10 april 2008, joseph david hayes and anthony gregory mcgrath were appointed administrators of lift.
in my view, the proof of debt procedure is more convenient.
this is a necessary ingredient in an application to bring proceedings against lift by way of cross-claim, as opposed to commencing a new action.
