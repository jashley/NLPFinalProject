the affidavit evidence filed by the respondents devotes greatest attention to the difficulties, financial and otherwise, which it is apprehended the individual respondents will confront were the trial of the proceeding to be held away from perth and, particularly, in melbourne.
the respondents' application will, therefore, be refused, without prejudice to their right to renew the application should circumstances change or when the proceeding is ready for trial.
it may or may not be necessary to consider whether evidence should also be heard at another place such as melbourne.
