the first matter was the consent of the group members to the settlement in the circumstances outlined above.
in an affidavit sworn by kim john whitby, the solicitor for the applicant, on 30 june 2009, he stated that the group members who attended the mediation and were part of the applicant's litigation committee contacted the other group members and advised them of their impressions of the mediation.
when all those matters are taken into account, the quantum of the settlement is amply justified.
