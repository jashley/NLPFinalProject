there followed a meeting between chad kim on behalf of kokos, ace pae on behalf of iae, rebekah cabalt on behalf of nanuri, bernard yeo on behalf of study overseas now and jacob kim on behalf of jobbok.
6 mr yeo was at all material times a servant or agent of study overseas now authorised by it to conduct business in its name and on its behalf and was responsible for its day to day management.
i will therefore make the declaratory and injunctive orders.
