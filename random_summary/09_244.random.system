in 1995, ms khadpekar, who was then carrying on business as a town planning consultant, entered into an agreement with the kowanyama aboriginal council to prepare a report on the formulation of a five-year plan for upgrading the existing safe storage facilities at the council.
it was said that the magistrates court rules in queensland permitted the court to waive any irregularities, and that it was to be inferred that by entering judgment against ms khadpekar in september 1997, after the july discovery order, the court had exercised its power to waive any irregularity in the previous process.
in 2006, the new south wales court of appeal upheld the plaintiff's appeal and extended the time to make the application to rescind the dismissal.
