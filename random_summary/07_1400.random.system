on none of the occasions when this matter has been before me has mr hudson appeared, despite service by the trustee of letters informing him of each date on which this matter was next to be before the court.
the trustee seeks leave of the court to distribute the sum of $56,617.50, received by him as trustee of mr hudson's property.
4 the trustee has established service of this application, effected on 10 november 2006.
