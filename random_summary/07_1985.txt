the order proposed by the liquidators, in my respectful opinion, lacks any sensible meaning.
the failure to obtain approval was innocent and based upon ignorance and oversight.
37 re associated travel, leisure &amp; services ltd [1978] 1 wlr 547 was a case in which a liquidator appointed solicitors without the prior sanction of the court or a committee of inspection as required by s 245(1) of the companies act 1948 (uk).
