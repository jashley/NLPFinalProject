the main dispute in the case was that the infringer argued for an "incremental" approach, ie the difference between the profits in fact made and the profits, if any, that would have been made if a non-infringing process were used (at [16]).
that is the enquiry that is directed.
in such a case it may be possible to disentangle the profits made on the infringing business and order them to be paid to the plaintiff notwithstanding the losses made elsewhere.
