they carry the weight not only of the previous understanding of the common law of contract but also the operation of the document penalties.
i am of opinion that unwired has no reasonable prospect of success of establishing an implication here, as a matter of law, that the rights attaching to intel's or a note holder's ability to convert its notes into shares, or to call for repayment in the events specified for default, are qualified by the compendious requirement that first, the note holder act only in good faith and reasonably, and secondly, that unwired be ready, willing and able to implement the wimax roll out.
for the reasons i have given, there is no reasonable prospect of construing the deed poll or the transaction as containing any such qualification.
