6 there is no doubt that there is some injustice to the respondents by their having to pay costs such as the costs of today and costs associated with preparing once again for the hearing by covering some of the older ground that had been covered in preparing for the hearing yesterday and today.
then there will be issues as to costs for both sides.
10 in all of the circumstances, i am of the opinion that it would not be in the interests of justice to fix a sum of costs at this stage.
