the position remains vacant.
railcorp did not make any determination with respect to this position within the meaning of cl 22.1 within four weeks of 6 january 2006 (that is, by 3 february 2006).
if "authorised position" means nothing more than "vacant position" the drafting of cl 22 makes little sense.
