however, in this case i think that the tribunal was required to do more than it did.
in the case before his honour, it was clear that, although improbable, it was possible that the tribunal would reach a different result.
the minister submits that the tribunal did not act in breach of s 359a of the act because the section did not apply to the information in question because it was information the appellant gave for the purpose of the application within the terms of s 359a(4)(b).
