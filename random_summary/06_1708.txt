as kirby j said in australian competition and consumer commission v cg berbatis holdings pty ltd [2003] hca 18 ; (2003) 197 alr 153 at 173 in relation to s 51aa: 'such equitable categories developed in order to protect the integrity of the contracting process where a party is induced to act or enter a transaction due to weakness or illegitimate pressure, and does so without full information or appreciation of the extent or nature of the transaction or the way it affects that party's interests and choices.
i refer to my comments in relation to count 1.
there is nothing to suggest that the person identified in the count was a witness in any matter before any court.
