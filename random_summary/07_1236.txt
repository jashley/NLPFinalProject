in assessing the damages payable, in this case it is of relevance that: a. the applicant has a psychiatric disability b. the applicant was unable to access the respondent's health services on a number of occasions, something that would obviously cause distress to a person with the applicant's medical condition and needs c. the discrimination on the part of the respondent resulted in the applicant being unable to utilise the assistance of his dogs when he wished to access the respondent's services, even though the dogs assisted the applicant to alleviate the effects of his disability d. there was wilful disregard of the applicant's rights by the respondent e. the respondent is a state government, and therefore should exhibit exemplary behaviour f. the applicant had little option but to accept the behaviour/treatment dealt out to him by the respondent g. the hurt suffered by the applicant continues almost three years after the events in question.
12 mr o'gorman sc for the applicant submitted that it would be appropriate for the queensland minister of health, as minister responsible for the respondent and the implementation of the respondent's relevant policies, to apologise to the applicant, and that while a public apology was not necessary the applicant sought a written apology from the minister on behalf of the respondent.
