100 in respect of these causes of action, mr r. buchanan qc, senior counsel for qantas catering, submitted: (1) the applicant has failed to prove any breach of the award or any of the certified agreements and there is, therefore, no basis for the imposition of penalties under section 178 of the wra.
this failure, however, does not avail mrs barrick, because, in my view, she received payslips which indicated what was being paid to her, or on her behalf, to her bank and other loan accounts; those monies were recorded in payslips which she received, and the monies exceeded the entitlements for the hours that she worked.
any alleged breach of award or certified agreement by anyone in this respect is misconceived.
