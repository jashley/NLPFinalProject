paragraphs 2 and 3 of that outline were in the following terms: (2) awb submits that two matters, each on its own sufficient, justify the order sought: (a) the first is that the non-common questions raised by the claims of the applicants ( watsons ) and group members are such that the proceeding will not provide an efficient and effective means of dealing with the claims of group members ( common questions issue ); (b) the second is that an element of the definition of the group members on whose behalf, as well as their own, the watsons have commenced the proceeding --- specifically, that element which defines the group by reference to persons who have entered into a litigation funding agreement with imf (australia) limited in relation to the proceeding on or before 30 october 2008 - has the effect that the proceeding will not provide an efficient and effective means of dealing with the claims of group members or it is otherwise inappropriate that those claims be pursued by means of a representative proceeding ( group definition issue ).
(3) as is apparent from this statement of issues on the motion, awb relies only on s 33n(1)(c) and (d) of the act and not on s 33n(1)(a) or (b).
on this point, the respondent has had success.
