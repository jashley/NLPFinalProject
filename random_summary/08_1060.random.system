that principle was applied by a full court of this court in darling harbourside (sydney) pty ltd v sanirise pty ltd (unreported, beaumont, carr, sackville jj, 17 may 1996) to an order for the provision of security for costs.
the importance of allowing the appellant such an opportunity was only reinforced by her again appearing on her own behalf and unrepresented.
