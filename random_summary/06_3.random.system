there was nothing in the independent evidence to satisfy the tribunal that the [appellant] will be denied state protection for the reason of her ethnicity, religion or her membership of a particular social group of "ethnic chinese women in indonesia".
in oral submissions, the appellant submitted that, had the tribunal applied the correct test, it would have been open to it to conclude that the failure by the authorities to protect the appellant was for a convention reason: the high court's decision in minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v khawar [2002] hca 14 ; (2002) 210 clr 1 (' khawar ') is authority for the proposition that criminal activity committed by a private individual, which is tolerated or condoned by the state because it systematically discriminates on convention grounds, may amount to persecution.
should she be wrongly returned to indonesia to face the risk of further persecution, it would be a bad affair.
