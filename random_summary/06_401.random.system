there appeared on the case before me to be little or no variation in the financial position of the applicant over the period before and after the making of the sequestration order.
the applicant states that she returned to the brisbane registry on 24 october 2005 to file the documents, however the notice she attempted to file on that day was again rejected on form grounds.
at best it purports to prove solvency at the time the affidavit was filed.
