subsection 17(5a) provides: (5a) the measures to be set out under paragraph (5)(b) in a plan of management for a fishery include: (a) providing for afma, after such consultations (if any) as are set out in the plan of management, to direct that fishing is not to be engaged in in the fishery, or a particular part of the fishery, during a particular period or periods; and (b) providing for holders of fishing concessions in respect of the fishery to be notified of the direction; and (c) obliging those holders to comply with the direction.
the effect of the buyout is that there now exists a smaller pool of fishing concession holders to share in the allocation of the sfrs in the fishery than when the aap made its report in april 2002.
the issue of relative permit values was the subject of vigorous submissions and responses.
