because the tribunal did not refer to s 70(5)(d) it failed to apply the correct test for determining whether mr robertson's condition was contributed to in a material degree or was aggravated by defence service rendered after he developed ptsd.
subsequently he experienced psychological stressors caused by his involvement in a diving incident in hong kong; being in proximity to hmas melbourne and experiencing a fire on hmas supply.
the tribunal found that mr robertson's major depression 'had its clinical onset in the mid 1990s' and continued: given this time range and the clinical onset of post traumatic stress disorder in 1994, i find it more probable than not that mr robertson had post traumatic stress disorder within one year immediately before the clinical onset of major depression.
