the tribunal considered both limbs of subclause (7a)(c)(iv), namely, whether the appellant had net assets of not less than $aud250,000 to conduct the business or, alternatively, net assets of a lesser amount adequate to conduct the business.
35 it is clear that the tribunal identified and applied the correct test and took into account all of the matters reflected in the report from mr thynne in the context of applying the identified test to the facts found or determined.
it is not correct to say therefore that the tribunal did not consider the type and nature of the business, the essential intellectual property character of the software assets or 'knowledge engines', the shareholding of the appellant in holdings and postulated values of that interest as an asset of the appellant.
