this suggests that the statement will be filed when it is left with an officer at the registry rather than when it has been placed on a file that is maintained at the registry.
i have sent certified letters to the last known addresses, being 33 manning street, double bay, new south wales and 33 st martins lane, south yarra, victoria.
given that the statement in the present proceeding was despatched from sydney on 19 april 1995, i consider that an allowance of two business days should be made such that the date of filing should be fixed, not as 19 april 1995 (the date of signing) but 21 april 1995.
