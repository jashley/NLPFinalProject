13 on 15 november 2006 the appeal against the decision of the receivers and managers to make funds available to forestview for the purpose of defending these proceedings was dismissed.
these matters and the character of the charge as fixed and floating are either not disputed or not able to be disputed and establish the factual foundation for the presumption of insolvency required by s 459c(2).
as the forestview receivers and managers had not been represented at the hearing on 30 october 2006, forestview was directed to file a minute of its proposed orders for the release of funds for legal representation and to serve on them a copy of that minute together with its supporting affidavits, the written submissions and the transcript of the proceedings on that day.
