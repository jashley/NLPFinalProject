15 proceeding on the basis that the offer documents do contain an estimate of the value of the debenture, it is necessary to decide whether this estimate is a "fair estimate" for the purposes of s 1019i(2)(c).
as regards the cumulative debentures, mr mcgrath said that a fair estimate of their value was between 99.2 and 120.8 cents (on each of 8 november 2005 and 23 november 2005) and between 100.9 and 123.0 cents on 22 january 2007.
not only did the offer documents not adequately explain to debenture holders the method by which the estimates of value were determined, but the estimates themselves, when compared to the estimates given by mr mcgrath and mr young, strongly point to the conclusion, which i think must inevitably be reached, that the estimates were not "fair estimates" of the value of the debentures.
