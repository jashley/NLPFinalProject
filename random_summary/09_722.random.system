it was not however impossible, and whilst ms yousif's claim was in this respect ambitious, i am not persuaded that the rejection of the offer was unreasonable in such a measure as she should be visited with indemnity costs for the period following the making of the offer.
mr mcdonald did, however, argue that the rejection of the offer was unreasonable insofar as the quantum of the offer was concerned, and the likelihood of the applicant being able to establish the assumption lying behind the assessment of the quantum of her case.
in those circumstances, it is not possible to segregate any costs which would be attributable to this element of the case.
