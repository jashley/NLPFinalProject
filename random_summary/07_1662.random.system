20 "authorisation" for the purposes of s 61(1) is defined in s 251b as follows: "for the purposes of this act, all the persons in a native title claim group ... authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application ... and to deal with matters arising in relation to it, if: (a) where there is a process of decision-making that, under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group ... must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind --- the persons in the native title claim group ... authorise the person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with that process; or (b) where there is no such process --- the persons in the native title claim group ... authorise the other person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with a process of decision-making agreed to and adopted, by the persons in the native title claim group ... in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with the matters, or in relation to doing things of that kind.
" the submissions earlier had observed that "mr kite's affidavit does not assert that there are only 5 men who are entitled to enjoy the traditional rights described ...; but it asserts that those rights are held by the 5 men named" (emphasis added).
(ii) as i indicated above, the schedule f description of native title rights and interests suggests on its face that aboriginal peoples other than the claim group acknowledge the same traditional laws and observe the same customs in relation to the claim area.
