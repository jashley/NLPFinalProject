surprisingly, that agreement does not expressly state when it was that toy shed became obligated to pay for any goods it ordered from playspace.
in relation to sale of goods, it seems to me that, in some cases, it will be the order which in substance and commercial reality renders the company liable for the price of the goods, even if that price is not actually payable until delivery; while in other cases, it will be the acceptance of delivery which, as a matter of substance and commercial reality, so renders the company liable.
on 19 october 2005, toy shed was placed in voluntary administration.
