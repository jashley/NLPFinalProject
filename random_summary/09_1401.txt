in effect, the denoon interests agreed by deed that they would not require, for a period, the new trustee to take their interests into account in exercising the power of allocation of the net income of the trust and they accepted that they could not, whatever might have been the source of any right to do so, assert any right in relation to any part of the trust fund during the period of suspension.
the deed by which the right of indemnity was extinguished provided for a waiver of a vested right in the former trustee.
the directors of the trustee may orally resolve to determine the trust.
