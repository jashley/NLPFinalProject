cissy considers djugan and yawuru to be the same thing because they practice 'the same law and the language [on] one side is heavier than [on] the other so ... if you had to say something in djugan it would mean the same thing in yawuru'.
on the issue of kinship, elkin's early field notes and his published work in social organisation reveal that the djugan and the yawuru each had the same four skin sections (which determined marriage and much social behaviour) although they had different kinship rules (which determined marriage requirements).
' it follows, so the state argues, that even if the djugan subsequently lost their separate identity as a tribe, and were absorbed into the yawuru community, that occurred post-sovereignty and cannot result in the historical native title rights and interests of the djugan community becoming native title rights and interests possessed by the yawuru community.
