the tribunal noted that there were omissions of certain details which were inconsistent with a genuine fear of persecution.
the federal magistrate held that the constitutional validity of ss 474, 475, and s 476 of the act could not be affected by other commonwealth enactments even if there were inconsistencies between them.
section 476 , although in a different form when the application was considered by the tribunal, was validly made because s 77(i) of the constitution allowed parliament to make laws defining the jurisdiction of any federal court other than the high court.
