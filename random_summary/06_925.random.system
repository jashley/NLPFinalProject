that is, it was claimed, the tribunal when addressing art 1c(5) had erred in law.
i note that the route from the applicant's village to sang-e masha is entirely within the central part of jaghori, not close to any district borders, and as there are no reports of incursions by pashtuns into jaghori, i discount this claim.
there is no additional element to be applied because of art 1c(5) in the convention.
