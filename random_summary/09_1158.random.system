a problem has arisen because of the interaction of s 249h(1) of the act and provisions of the company's constitution (memorandum and articles of association) relating to the nomination of persons for election as directors at an agm.
because mr whittingham desires to have the other business of an agm also dealt with, he prefers that an agm rather than an egm be convened.
section 447a provides in subs (1) that the court may make such order as it thinks appropriate as to how pt 5.3a is to operate in relation to a particular company.
