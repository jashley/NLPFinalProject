the question that arises is whether an order ought to be made under s 137(5) directing the customs ceo not to release the goods to the designated owner.
section 137 recognises that a trade mark owner may elect to bring proceedings and ss 136 and 137 address what is to occur in the circumstances of those sections in respect of seized goods if the relevant steps are not taken.
it is clear that the proceeding was not commenced within the extension period and, by definition, notice was not given to the customs service of the proceeding within the extension period.
