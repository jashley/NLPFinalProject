i am satisfied that the court has power to make the proposed consent orders; see ss 81 and 87 of the act.
a native title determination may be a claimant application or a non-claimant application; see s 253 of the act.
this is not a case in which any previous native title has been extinguished by previous exclusive possession acts within s 23b or, otherwise within division 2b of part 2.
