in substance, i also think that the applicant is entitled to an order more or less to that effect.
doing the best i can and appreciating that the assessment which i am about to make is rather broad, but taking into account my detailed knowledge of the matter and the work that was done in order to bring the proceedings forward, i propose to order that the respondent pay the costs of the applicant of and incidental to these proceedings, including reserved costs assessed at the amount of $40,000.
the applicant also seeks relief in the nature of default relief should the respondent fail to comply with the order which i just made.
