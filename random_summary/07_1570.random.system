this topic was addressed by lindgren j in apn news &amp; media limited [2007] fca 770 , in particular at [43], [46]-[49] and [55].
i am also satisfied that the issue referred to in [27] of investa , namely, the "vesting free of encumbrances" term is sufficiently addressed.
although there is no affidavit evidence along the lines of that referred to by lindgren j at [55], i would infer that there had been arm's length negotiations between the parties because each of the parties is independently represented by experienced firms of solicitors.
