it would follow would it not, that if in the unlikely event that rtre paid $1,750,000 to the trustee, the trustee would then be required to pay $1,225,000 to meriton, which would result in the trustee netting $525,000, being the amount which i consider should be claimed under the notice.
the official receiver opposes the making of any order for costs against her.
i am not satisfied that the notice can be construed as one which seeks to impose a personal liability on the administrator rather than a bare liability on the company of which he was the administrator.
