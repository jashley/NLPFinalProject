18.2.2 entitlement the employee is entitled to payment in lieu of long service leave equal to: 18.2.2(a) 1/80 of the period of his or her continuous service with that employer prior to 1 march 1965; and 18.2.2(b) 1/60 of the period of his or her continuous service with that employer subsequent to 28 february 1965.
if the intention were to provide generally for payment in lieu of long service leave on a pro rata basis one would not find 18.3 in its present form.
