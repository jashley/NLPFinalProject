in these circumstances, as in prestige property services pty ltd v liquor, hospitality and miscellaneous union [2006] fca 180 per kenny j, it is appropriate that the appellants have a limited stay subject to conditions.
in such a case the appellant has to show there would be no reasonable probability of getting back moneys paid under the judgment if the appeal succeeds: see andrews v john fairfax &amp; sons ltd [1979] 2 nswlr 184 at 189 ... 9 in welcome real-time sa v catuity inc (no 2) [2002] fca 258 heerey j granted a stay, where the applicant for the stay offered to pay the costs into an interest-bearing account pro tem and the other party was a foreign company.
