the reason for this is that the appellants' own evidence before the tribunal was to the effect that the first appellant was not a shareholder of the company on which the appellants relied to satisfy cl 845.221 of sch 2 to the migration regulations as the shares in that company were held by the second appellant.
as i raised this issue of materiality during the hearing i gave both parties an opportunity to make further written submissions about it.
the tribunal did not do so because it inferred that there must have been a benefit to the first appellant in winding up rei and setting up multi as a "new business" (that is, avoiding adverse personal consequences by reason of laws regulating corporations).
