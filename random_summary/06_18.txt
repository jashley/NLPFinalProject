on the information currently available to me that amount is no more than $9,953,426.10.
the likelihood, i would have thought, is that the entity served with the notice may well ignore it because the circumstances may be such that if it complies with the notice and pays the commissioner, it may not be entitled to rely on the indemnity provided by s 260-15.
much will depend on the proper law governing the terms of the indebtedness between the entity served with the notice and the tax debtor.
