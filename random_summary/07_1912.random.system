14 first, on 30 november 2005, the appellant applied for review of the delegate's decision by the rrt.
4 the amended notice of appeal contained one ground of appeal: that the federal magistrate erred in not finding that the rrt committed a "jurisdictional error" in that the decision of the rrt was affected by apprehended bias.
i accept that the "new evidence" is not identified in the submissions by the [appellant], and in any event i am satisfied that where there is a claim for apprehended bias, it is not appropriate for this court to permit new evidence to be adduced.
