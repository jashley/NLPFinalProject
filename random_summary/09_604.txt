neither mr forbes nor mr atkins was cross-examined on the contents of their affidavits and i was not invited to conclude that the veracity of what is deposed to in their affidavits is in doubt.
the evidence also is that neither applicant is the registered proprietor of any real property in new south wales.
the applicant is required to do no more than place on the record credible testimony and the exercise of the court at this stage is in judging the testimony and its quality rather than seeing if a matter has been proved by inference.
