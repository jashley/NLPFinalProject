28 in several cases, the delaware court of chancery has made passing reference to naked no vote break fees without suggesting disapproval: see emerson radio corp v international jensen inc 1996 wl 483086 (del ch 1996) at 9; hills stores co v bozic 769 a2d 88 (del ch 2000) at 104; and mcmillan v intercargo corp 768 a2d 492 (del ch 2000) at 505.

in paramount communications inc v qvc network inc 637 a2d 34 (del supr 1993) a us$100 million break fee was payable, inter alia, in the naked no vote situation.
