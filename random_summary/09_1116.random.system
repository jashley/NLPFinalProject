section 606 provides that: (1) subject to sections 607 to 607b, a newstart activity agreement with a person is to require the person to undertake one or more activities that the secretary regards as suitable for the person.
in particular, the tribunal rejected mr piotto's contentions that the proposed newstart activity agreement was flawed, contained unreasonable terms and the respondent had not shown that there was a valid delegation of the respondent's powers to matchworks.
the regulations in force at the relevant time proscribed terms from inclusion in a newstart activity agreement pursuant to s 606(1b) of the act; see social security (activity agreement requirements) (dewr) determination 2006 (cth) ("the determination").
