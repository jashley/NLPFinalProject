section 251k(1) stipulates that in specified circumstances the board shall suspend or cancel the registration of a tax agent and in such a case by virtue of s 251k(3b) the period of such a suspension "shall not be less than three months".
" 10 in my view it clearly is the case that, having committed an error of law in the manner in which it rejected the applicant's submission for a lesser suspension than three months and having just fixed the suspension imposed because of that error of law, the tribunal cannot properly rely upon s 43aa to vary its decision in substance by excising the formal manifestation of that error of law in the manner adopted in the direction, thus allowing its decision to be sustained inferentially by s 251k(3).
" it is the above paragraph [26] which clearly gives an erroneous reason for rejecting the applicant's submission that was in issue in this appeal.
