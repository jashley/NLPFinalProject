the appellant's evidence at question 6 of the visa application was not adopted by the appellant at the hearing before the tribunal, and needed to be adopted by the appellant before being deemed to have been given to the tribunal by the appellant: nbkt v mima [2006] fcafc 195.
" &#8226; the tribunal also noted that the applicant produced an undated letter faxed to him from bangladesh "purporting to be from md mahbubur rahman, general secretary, bangladesh awami league, dhaka zila unit, certifying that the applicant is an activist of the jubo league and stating that the bnp and jamaat-e-islami took powering 2001 through a rigged election....and that as part of this the applicant has been implicated in concocted manslaughter cases" &#8226; the tribunal said that the appellant had told the tribunal that, so far as he was aware, all the answers in his original application were correct and complete &#8226; the tribunal stated "the applicant said that the charge against him in relation to the killing of the bnp supporter on 5 september 2001 was still pending.
the primary reason for this view is that it is very clear that, although the tribunal did raise the inconsistency between the answer to question 6 in the appellant's protection visa application and his subsequent evidence: &#8226; the appellant was given the opportunity to explain the inconsistency and did so to the tribunal; and &#8226; more importantly, the issue was not raised again nor mentioned again by the tribunal in any context, including as part of its reasons for decision.
