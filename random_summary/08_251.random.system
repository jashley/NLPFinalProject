14 section 501(6) provides that a person does not pass the character test if, inter alia : (a) the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection (7)); or ... (c) having regard to either or both of the following: (i) the person's past and present criminal conduct; (ii) the person's past and present general conduct; the person is not of good character; or 15 section 501(7) defines a substantial criminal record as being circumstances where, inter alia : ... (c) the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more; or (d) the person has been sentenced to 2 or more terms of imprisonment (whether on one or more occasions), where the total of those terms is 2 years or more; or 16 in its reasoning, the tribunal also took into account direction no 21 visa refusal and cancellation under s 501 migration act 1958 ("direction no 21"), issued by the minister on 23 august 2001 pursuant to s 499(1) migration act .
instead, the applicant addressed problems he had faced in obtaining evidence favourable to his case before the tribunal.
from the applicant's description of the information in the prison reports he was unable to access (ts p 11 ll 12-38), it appears unlikely that it would have added to the case he put to the tribunal.
