' 16 on 23 january 2006 the tribunal member made directions about the filing of written submissions by each of the parties.
i agree with that as a general statement, but i think that this is an appropriate case.
section 43(1) provides: '(1) for the purpose of reviewing a decision, the tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred by any relevant enactment on the person who made the decision and shall make a decision in writing: (a) affirming the decision under review; (b) varying the decision under review; or (c) setting aside the decision under review and: (i) making a decision in substitution for the decision so set aside; or (ii) remitting the matter for reconsideration in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the tribunal.
