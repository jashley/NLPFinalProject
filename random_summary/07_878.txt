although it may be accepted, in the present case, that the trial may have been somewhat shorter had the respondent conceded the breach of the lease, this, in my opinion, is not sufficient to warrant a departure from the consequences prescribed by o 23 r 11(5).
the applicant pleaded causes of action in rectification, contractual breach of a lease, waste, unconscionable conduct contrary to ss 51aa and 51ac of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) and contraventions of ss 52 and 53 (g) of that act and sought various forms of relief.
o 23 r 11(5) 6 order 23 r 11(5) provides for the making of orders of the kind sought by the respondent (apart from the proposed one third reduction in relation to costs incurred prior to 26 november 2005).
