ss submitted that there was an inconsistency between the statement of facts and circumstances (which said that a notation may, not must, be included in reliance on s 29a(2(b)) and the examiner's reasons (which said that if such a notation were not included it "would" reasonably be expected to prejudice the effectiveness of the operation in apparent reliance on s 29a(2)(a)).
(6) the summons is defective on its face as: - (i) the summons does not require ss to attend at an examination to give evidence in a capacity as a witness to federally relevant criminal activity within the meaning of the acc act, and (ii) the statement of rights and obligations under s 29b of the acc act which was annexed to the summons does not set out a person's rights and obligations under s 29b(3) or 29b(4) of the acc act as required.
the former is subject to ss 29b(1) and (2).
