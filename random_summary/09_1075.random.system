allphones was not represented before the registrar on 8 october 2008, when the bdo subpoena was answered.
for reasons which i will explain, i do not need to decide this point for present purposes (see ringrow pty ltd v bp australia ltd [2003] fca 933 ; (2003) 130 fcr 569 at [9] ---[21] (pp 571-573) for a discussion of some of the relevant issues).
these reasons for judgment address and determine whether allphones' resistance to an order ruling that the three documents in question are admissible on the grounds that, in any event, they are not business records and that the tender is prohibited by s 131 of the evidence act , should be upheld at this point in time.
