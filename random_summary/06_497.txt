in plaintiff s157/2002 , gaudron, mchugh, gummow, kirby and hayne jj concluded at 506 [76], that s 474 of the migration act must be read 'so as to refer to decisions which involve neither a failure to exercise jurisdiction nor an excess of the jurisdiction conferred by the [migration act]' because an administrative decision which involved jurisdictional error was 'properly regarded, in law, as no decision at all': see also minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v bhardwaj [2002] hca 11 ; (2002) 209 clr 597, per gaudron and gummow jj at 615 [51].
