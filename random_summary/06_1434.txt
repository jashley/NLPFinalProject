the case was that it was not foreseeable that somebody would or could dishonestly obtain one of a1's other keys, and steal the vehicle from the appellant's premises.
there is nothing put before me to suggest that the proceedings were prolonged or complicated in any way by her unnecessary joinder as an applicant.
that failure however does not seem to me to deal with what the appellant might have reasonably foreseen.
