if you don't order promptly wheat will be unprocurable at the price we are now offering, and there'll be no wheat available from march onwards.
there is a parcel of wheat remaining, and you can buy it.
i accept that mr vickery regarded 'awb' as the most reliable source of information available as to the future supply of wheat.
