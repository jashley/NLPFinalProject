the tendering of a statement that asic has no objection to the approval of a scheme of arrangement is given weight in the sense that the court will have regard to the views of a regulatory body experienced and practised in the discipline the subject of its area of regulatory engagement.

mr polson applied the asic guide which provides that an offer is "reasonable" if it is fair and concluded that since the offer of the proposed scheme proposed a fair outcome for a shareholder, the proposed scheme was "reasonable".
