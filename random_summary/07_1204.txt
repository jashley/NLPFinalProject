19 ground 5 asserts that the rrt failed to comply with its obligations under s 425 of the migration act 1958 (cth) by not giving the appellant an adequate opportunity to respond to independent evidence in the rrt's possession which suggested that it was possible for buddhists to engage in religious activities in bangladesh without being subjected to violence, or threats thereof.
on 1 july 2004, a delegate of the respondent minister refused that application.
5 the appellant's claims, as presented to the rrt, may be summarised as follows: &#8226; he was a buddhist monk, and held a senior position at a monastery in dhaka; &#8226; in about april 2002 a particular lord abbot who was well known to him was killed by suspected muslim extremists; &#8226; he participated in a march protesting against the killing.
