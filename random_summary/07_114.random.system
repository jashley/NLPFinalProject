139 turning to the question of mr stergiotis's "specialised knowledge" as such, i must say that this question was rather glossed over in the submissions of the respondent.
relevantly to the opinion expressed in the final sentence of par 37 of his affidavit, the only evidence which mr stergiotis gave as to his knowledge of the behaviour of retailers came in response to a series of questions in chief, the first of which invited him to state how a hypothetical retailer, having both the sl-217 and the sl-500 in its range, would have offered those products to the market.
in the circumstances, i took the view that the probative value of the exhibit was substantially outweighed by the danger that the admission of the exhibit into evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the applicant, and ruled that the exhibit not be admitted pursuant to s 135 of the evidence act .
