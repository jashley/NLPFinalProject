the appellant asked that the appeal be listed for hearing at some other time.
buchanan j: this is an appeal against a judgment of the federal magistrates court of australia which dismissed an application for judicial review concerning a decision of the refugee review tribunal constituted under the migration act 1958 (cth).
accordingly, i am satisfied that the present is a suitable case to exercise the power to which mr reynolds has referred and that it is appropriate that the appeal be dismissed for that reason.
