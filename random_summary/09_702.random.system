a second aspect of the overall arrangement was the proposal that ms rutter perform the original piece of music and other music on three occasions: 9 august 1999 in melbourne, 11 august 1999 in sydney and 20 november 1999 at the brookland valley vineyard.
this fee shall be payable as to the total amount of item 4 on the schedule, payable to jane rutter on the date of this agreement.
and so that, at the point in which your inquiries were exhausted, shortly after the receipt of this material attached to the letter from gadens of 18 april 2007, you were in the position where the company couldn't establish a licence or permission granted by ms rutter?---correct.
