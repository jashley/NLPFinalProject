it is unknown what value this contingent asset would have in a liquidation scenario.
the submission made in opposition to the deputy commissioner's application was that i should be satisfied, on the material by then to hand, that it was in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up.
it by no means follows that a decision made on the limited materials then to hand is in any way conclusive as to what now should be the fate of the administration.
