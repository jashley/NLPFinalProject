no notice was given pursuant to article 5(c) by the proposed transferors, and (so far as the evidence shows) no resolution was passed by the directors selecting either bishop estate or excess as a desirable person in the interests of the company to admit to membership.
141 i have found that territory realty, through both booth and sanders, came to know at the 29 may 2003 shareholders' meeting of dundee beach p/l that bishop estate and excess somehow had an interest in dundee beach p/l.
323 i propose to order, therefore, that, in the first instance, bishop estate and/or excess purchase the shares of territory realty in dundee beach p/l at a price which i will shortly determine.
