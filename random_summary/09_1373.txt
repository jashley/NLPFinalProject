order to expunge from the record/file all the unfair and unwarranted comments that are unfounded, derogatory, libellous, slanderous, and extremely unfair allegations against mr. vijitha (viji) de alwis made by his honour federal magistrate ludev (sic-lucev).
i have indicated earlier that the proper course is to proceed with an application for leave to appeal, because the decision of the learned federal magistrate was an interlocutory decision.
the court of appeal, however, came to the view that as a matter of merit the breach was so serious as to demonstrate unfitness for further practice which was also demonstrated by the manner in which he had participated in the disciplinary proceedings themselves.
