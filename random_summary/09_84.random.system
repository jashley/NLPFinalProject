i should also mention that the appellant forwarded a letter to my chambers after the hearing dated 11 february 2009.
i agree and thus dismiss the notice of motion with costs.
from the appellant's point of view the tribunal and federal magistrates court erred and yet his appeal cannot be heard in order to correct the error.
