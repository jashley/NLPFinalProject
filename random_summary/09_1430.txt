similarly, it is at this stage impossible to evaluate the significance and likely success of counterclaim, which, in the circumstances, i do not consider has any particular bearing on the respondents' entitlement to security (although it could impinge upon the calculation of any quantum to be ordered).
as heerey j said in farmitalia 28 ipr at 345, "if very little information is put before the court on which it can estimate the amount of costs, ... it might be reasonable to make a large discount, particularly since if security proves inadequate as the litigation progresses, a further application may be made for more security".
ms bennett, for the respondents, argued that this was a modest sum in the context of contemporary litigation in this court.
