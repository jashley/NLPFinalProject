further, i note that: &#8226; the expert witnesses --- mr jon norling, director of urban economics, for the applicant and mr philip williams, executive chairman of frontier economics pty ltd, for the respondent --- agreed as to the existence of the wholesale market and the retail market (joint expert statement of areas of agreement and disagreement, 4 september 2006), and the existence of markets in which real estate agents compete (report of frontier economics pty ltd "competition among real estate agents: a report prepared for clarkekann", comment of mr williams ts p 72 ll 34-35, evidence of mr norling, ts p 100 ll 25-35); and &#8226; in the applicant's outline of submissions the applicant noted that the parties agreed, on the pleadings, as to the existence of the wholesale and retail and real estate agents' services markets (applicant's outline of submissions para 72).
&#8226; as pointed out in queensland wire , the existence of market power is identifiable by reference to factors including pricing, barriers to entry, market share.
as i noted earlier in this judgment, in the case of "developers" (including the applicant) the information access and pricing policy contemplated payment to the department a royalty fee and/or upfront fee approved by an authorised delegated officer of the department.
