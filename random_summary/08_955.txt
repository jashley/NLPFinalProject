first, mr healey in his email to mr reynolds said that if there were changes made then mr pannekoek would need to re-sign the contract.
alternatively, the applicants claim damages against harbeth for breach of warranty and for breaches of ss 51aa , 51ac and 52 of the tpa, and against mr healey and pa (2004) for breach of s 52 of the tpa and/or s 10 of the fair trading act 1987 (wa).
it cannot be said, in my opinion, that the applicants' case in this respect has no reasonable prospects of success.
