the notice of motion was filed on 24 june 2008 and brought on for hearing later that day as a matter of urgency.
there was no representative of the australian crime commission ('the commission') on the taskforce and, as far as i was (and am) aware, the work of the taskforce was separate from, and independent of, the work of the commission.
while i consider it would have been preferable for the applicant's solicitor, who appeared on that occasion, to have advised me that it was considering applying to have me disqualify myself, the applicant did make its application within a very short period of time thereafter, and before the substantive hearing commenced on 30 june 2008.
