31 in all the circumstances i am satisfied that under s 824(2) (and if necessary s 666(1)(b)) of the wr act it would be proper to order ms mcdonald to also 'pay some or all of' the costs in the proceedings up to the time of the abandonment of the claims under the wr act (and thereafter, if i am wrong in my earlier conclusion that there is a free-standing power to award costs from 4 october 2007).
25 it should be apparent from the reasons stated in the earlier judgment that, apart from the question of summary dismissal, the remaining claims were, in my view, ambitious.
does that, prima facie at least, suggest that no order for costs can be made at all in the proceedings?
