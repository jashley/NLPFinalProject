1 i have before me an appeal from a judgment of federal magistrate emmett of 9 november 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal of 20 june 2006, handed down on 4 july 2006, by which the tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, minister for immigration and citizenship, to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.
24 in relation to the general question of unfairness, i have canvassed the content of the transcript not only in terms of the specific issues addressed by the tribunal member but also in terms of the tribunal member's explanation of the notion of a well-founded fear of persecution, the explanation of the role to be discharged by the tribunal in considering the matters afresh, and the invitation by the tribunal to the appellant to place any other matter before it, or to add any other observations orally that would assist or support the appellant's contentions.
there is, in the appeal book before me, a transcript of the hearing and some aspects of the transcript require some attention.
