nor does s 127 manifest a legislative intent that normally the discretionary power conferred by s 101(2) should be exercised such that an order for the removal of a mark should take place as from the end of the non-use period.
reference may thus be made, by way of example, to s 79 which provides as follows: renewal within 6 months after registration expires if, within 6 months after the registration of a trade mark has expired, a person asks the registrar, in accordance with subsection 75(2), to renew the registration of the trade mark, the registrar must renew the registration of the trade mark for 10 years from the day on which the registration expired.
