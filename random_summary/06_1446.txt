53 justice hely did not make an order for specific performance of the option.
24 in the argument before me, the substantial issue was whether costs involved in proceedings before hely j and the appeals concerning the legal characteristics of the option could be said to arise out of any default by ringrow under the posa (cl a14.2(f)) or to be costs or expenses incurred by bp in exercising or enforcing any of bp's powers, rights or remedies under the posa or otherwise arising from a breach of the posa by ringrow (cl a16.9(a)).
clause a13.2 which hely j held bp had validly utilized, provided that if the dealer breached certain provisions of the posa, including cl a4.16 (which dealt with sale of non bp petroleum products), and the default were capable of rectification but was not totally rectified within 30 days after written notice of both the default and what was needed to remedy it were given to the dealer, bp was entitled to terminate the posa at any time thereafter by giving a written notice of termination to the dealer.
