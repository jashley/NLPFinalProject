those non-financial aspects of victim impact are such that the perpetrator of the contravention is to some extent rendered immune, or at least afforded a degree of immunity, from a likelihood of complaint, in my opinion.
there is no doubt that the contravening conduct concerned was deliberate.
what then was the role of jobspy and mr moles in that conduct?
