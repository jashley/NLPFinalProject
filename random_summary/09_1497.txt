i'm happy to do that.
mr krok submitted that the decision recorded in the letter of 30 november 2009, being the letter from mr tanna signed per ms zakos, was the letter recording the relevant decision not to postpone the time requirement in the further notice.
on 27 november 2009, in circumstances where there was not a response from the ato by 5.00 pm on 26 november 2009, mr mckeough sent a further letter noting the fact that there was no response and asserting that mr krok, therefore, intended to assume that his request for postponement had been deemed refused.
