crane work at the site was only affected for 90 minutes and during this time the sergi employees continued to perform other work at the site.
in view of considerations discussed, i consider that the appropriate range of penalty is in the lower to medium range for the contravention of the union and that the penalty agreed by the parties is appropriate in all the circumstances.
absent the parties' agreement i would not have imposed a penalty in that amount on the second respondent but as the agreed penalty is within the permissible range, albeit barely, i will order accordingly.
