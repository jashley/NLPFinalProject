152 i should add that the inference the applicant asks me to draw flies in the face of a statement in the file note of 10 may 2004 that ms smith left crs permanently in 2002.
the applicant's answers established that she had never been contacted by crs, that she had not been invited to participate in an assessment program with crs and that she had not been asked to participate in a rehabilitation program with crs.
the context in which these comments are said to have been made was not apparent on the evidence.
