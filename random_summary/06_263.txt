9 the appeal must inevitably be dismissed with costs.
1 this is an appeal from the whole of the judgment of nicholls fm given and published on 24 october 2005, whereby his honour dismissed an application for review of the decision of the refugee review tribunal delivered on 2 august 2004, which in turn affirmed the decision of the minister's delegate made on 21 january 2000 to refuse a protection visa to the appellant.
following the disastrous results sustained by the people's party in the ensuing election in georgia, the appellant claimed to have been left with no one to defend or support him.
