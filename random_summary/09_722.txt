a fuller picture of her commission earnings is set out at [19] of the primary reasons for judgment: yousif v commonwealth bank of australia (no 2) [2009] fca 656.
it was not however impossible, and whilst ms yousif's claim was in this respect ambitious, i am not persuaded that the rejection of the offer was unreasonable in such a measure as she should be visited with indemnity costs for the period following the making of the offer.
this conclusion is supported by the fact that the loss of commission was not ms yousif's only claim.
