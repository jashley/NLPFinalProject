16 mr upton has not asserted that he is impecunious, but only that he is unable to provide security for "$25 000 or any like sum".
9 mr upton also took issue with the estimate of tasmanian perpetual trustees that the appeal would consume three days' hearing time.
19 the appeal will be stayed until such security is provided or until further order and mr upton is to pay tasmanian perpetual trustees' costs of its motion for security for costs.
