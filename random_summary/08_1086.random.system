9 the applicant's acceptance that some order for security for costs was not able to be resisted effectively reduced the field of real debate to one about quantum.
the amount suggested by mr dimitriadis for this element was effectively about $20,000 (+ gst).
in my view the matter should be assessed, if necessary, in the light of the result of the proceedings as a whole.
