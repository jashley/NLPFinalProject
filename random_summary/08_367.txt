however, there is considerable force in the view that, when the tribunal came to apply the principles articulated in bui [1999] fca 118 ; 85 fcr 134 to the question of "undue cost" and its overriding discretion to waive the requirements of par 4007(1)(c), it failed to properly consider or give any weight to the opinions of dr chen.
