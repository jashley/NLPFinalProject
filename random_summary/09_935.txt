the use of the future conditional tense ("would be") rather than the indicative strongly suggests that the operation of s 424a(1)(a) is to be determined in advance --- and independently --- of the tribunal's particular reasoning on the facts of the case.
section 424a presently provides as follows: information and invitation given in writing by tribunal (1) subject to subsections (2a) and (3), the tribunal must: (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and (b) ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why it is relevant to the review, and the consequences of it being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review; and (c) invite the applicant to comment on or respond to it.
given its findings of fact, the conclusion of the tribunal was inevitable.
