the draft notice of appeal seeks to challenge the orders and judgment of a federal magistrate given 15 july 2009 (see sznhn v minister for immigration and citizenship [2009] fmca 702) , dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal (tribunal) made on 2 february 2009.
order 52, r 15(2) provides a flexible discretion to the court as to what will constitute a "special reason" for the grant of an extension of time.
in those circumstances, even if the applicant had raised a claim to be at risk from political opponents of the dmk, as the first respondent submitted, the tribunal would not have been required to make a finding on that claim because it rejected the factual premise on which such a claim rested (see waee v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2003] fcafc 184 ; (2003) 75 ald 630).
