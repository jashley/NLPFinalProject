section 596a of the corporations act provides as follows: the court is to summon a person for examination about a corporation's examinable affairs if: (a) an eligible applicant applies for the summons; and (b) the court is satisfied that the person is an officer or provisional liquidator of the corporation or was such an officer or provisional liquidator during or after the 2 years ending: (i) if the corporation is under administration --- on the section 513c day in relation to the administration; or (ii) if the corporation has executed a deed of company arrangement that has not yet terminated --- on the section 513c day in relation to the administration that ended when the deed was executed; or (iii) if the corporation is being, or has been, wound up --- when the winding up began; or (iv) otherwise --- when the application is made.
