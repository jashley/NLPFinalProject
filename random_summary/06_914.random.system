it is thus a mixed question of fact and law and, for this reason, not a question of law within the meaning of s 44(1) of the aat act (see etheridge at [16]).
order 53 r 3(2) of the federal court rules (and see also form 55a) requires the notice of appeal to state separately the question or questions of law to be raised on the appeal, the order sought and the grounds relied upon in support of the order sought.
it is sufficient to observe that they make clear that the subject matter of an appeal under s 44(1) of the aat act is the question (or questions) of law stated in the notice of appeal.
