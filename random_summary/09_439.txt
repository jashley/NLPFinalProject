in general terms, in settling the litigation, the parties agreed that barton international would sell all its various interests to girl for a consideration which comprised cash and a long term supply contract enabling barton international to buy from gma garnet 35,000 tonnes of garnet per annum at prices which effectively represented cost of production and a further 15,000 tonnes per annum at those prices plus 15%.

on the contrary, both barton international and girl agreed to cause gma garnet to enter the gsa: see cl 4.1(d) of the principal agreement.
