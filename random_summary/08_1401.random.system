however, the court now has the benefit of s 38 of the act in which it is made clear that, however plausible dowsett j's judicial definition of "in rail transport" as a "system" might be in the abstract, the legislature has chosen to define the term more narrowly as a subset of that whole system.
the most natural reading of a series of subclauses each beginning with the same word is that each is co-equal and each attaches to the full predicate preceding the first item in the list.
however, i am now bound to follow the full court's decision in ostwald that the act is to be construed narrowly, which creates a presumption in favour of the commissioner.
