although there is no affidavit evidence along the lines of that referred to by lindgren j at [55], i would infer that there had been arm's length negotiations between the parties because each of the parties is independently represented by experienced firms of solicitors.
nevertheless, mr oakes drew my attention to a number of aspects of the scheme.
prior to the hearing, counsel for the plaintiff, mr oakes sc, provided me with comprehensive written submissions outlining the scheme and setting out in detail the evidence necessary for me to make the orders at this hearing.
