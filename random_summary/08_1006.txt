however as i will observe below, lockhart j also went further to explain other jurisdictional reasons why an examination summons (or in fact orders to attend for an examination) were not within the scope of o 8 r 3 fcr as those rules then stood.
the extensions found in r 1 to the common law rule that jurisdiction is based on presence within the geographical jurisdiction of the court provide significant connecting factors sufficient to justify the court exercising jurisdiction in relation to persons outside the jurisdiction.
from my brief acquaintance with the matter, i would agree with this assessment.
