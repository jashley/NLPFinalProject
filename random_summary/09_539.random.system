subject to one qualification, i consider that the undertakings proffered by the remaining respondents sufficiently meet the case for interlocutory injunctive relief that acma has established.
i should add that, contrary to acma's submission, i do not regard apprehended burdens of monitoring as a sufficient basis for prohibiting the remaining respondents from engaging what would, absent a court order, otherwise be lawful conduct.
at the present stage of these proceedings, the question is whether and in what terms interlocutory injunctive relief should be granted, or whether undertakings which have been proffered by particular respondents should be regarded as a sufficient answer to the claim for interlocutory injunctive relief.
