whether or not that inference is accepted, bavaria nv does not rely upon any use or intended use of the mark for the purposes of s 41(5) of the act nor does it rely upon prior use for the purposes of s 41(6).
mr yardley's evidence, which i prefer as an indication of the reaction of the australian consumer, leads to the conclusion that consumers would not make a connection between the trade mark with the reference to "bavaria" on one hand and the german state or the origin of the beer on the other.
it is not in dispute that beer sold by bavaria nv under or by reference to the trade mark is made in the netherlands.
