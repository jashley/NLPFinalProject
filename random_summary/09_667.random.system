the tribunal's statement, "the absence of such confinement is demonstrated by his capacity to retain possession of his rifle and ammunition for some two hours and then to leave the area and go to the beach.
as the facts found by the administrative appeals tribunal (the tribunal) reveal, behind the rather terse and cryptic entries in his record of service (the event date entries for june 1941 really note a recording rather than true event date), lies a tale of derring-do and resourcefulness that, in mr collett's 100 th year (he will turn 100 on 25 august 2009), has manifested itself in a controversy.
with each of these opinions i respectfully agree.
