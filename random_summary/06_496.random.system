the time factor is such that he has been aware - the documents have been served upon him some six months ago now and that certainly is a reasonable time in which to prepare for the proceedings.
on the day of his release, he was arrested under a provisional arrest warrant which had been issued by a magistrate under s 12 of the act.
section 19(1) provides: 'determination of eligibility for surrender (1) where: (a) a person is on remand under section 15; (b) the attorney-general has given a notice under subsection 16(1) in relation to the person; (c) an application is made to a magistrate by or on behalf of the person or the extradition country concerned for proceedings to be conducted in relation to the person under this section; and (d) the magistrate considers that the person and the extradition country have had reasonable time in which to prepare for the conduct of such proceedings; the magistrate shall conduct proceedings to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender in relation to the extradition offence or extradition offences for which surrender of the person is sought by the extradition country.
