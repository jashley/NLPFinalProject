relevantly, s 65 provided: '65(1) after considering a valid application for a visa, the minister: (a) if satisfied that; ... (ii) the other criteria for it prescribed by this act or the regulations have been satisfied; ... is to grant the visa; or (b) if not so satisfied, is to refuse to grant the visa.
the tribunal was constituted for the purposes of the review by tribunal member ms o'toole, who appears to have conducted a hearing which lasted for approximately four hours on 11 july 2006.
the appellants urge that the tribunal failed to afford the appellants an opportunity to present arguments concerning their religious observance in australia with a view to arguing that it was not colourable, that it was not simply engaged in for the purpose of bolstering their protection visa applications, and that it was genuine and consistent with their conversion to christianity prior to their arrival in australia.
