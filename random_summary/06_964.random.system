rather, uts relies on an amalgamation of the definition of "program" in the broadcasting services act 1992 (cth) (which of course post-dates the act) and the construction of the expression "australian content of programs" by brennan cj in project blue sky inc v australian broadcasting authority [1998] hca 28 ; (1998) 194 clr 355 at [22] to submit that program material is limited to ' the sights and sounds which are capable of transmission to an audience for the purpose of education or informing or even for advertising or sponsorship '.
the abc's submissions are to the effect that the exemption is "in relation to documents in relation to its program material".
uts does not submit that the exemption extends only to documents that fall within that aspect of the definition of "document" in s 4(a) that refers to "material", that is s 4(a)(iv).
