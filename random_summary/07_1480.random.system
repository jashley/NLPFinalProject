on 11 january 2007, pursuant to s 68 of the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 (cth) (the act), centennial referred the project to the minister for the environment and water resources, the first respondent in this proceeding, for a determination as to whether the project is a "controlled action" within the meaning of s 67 of the act.
the assessment of whether an impact is or is not significant is a question of fact; minister for environment and heritage v greentree [2004] fca 741 ; (2004) 138 fcr 198 at [192] .
to my mind the purpose of the act is to prevent or minimise such adverse impact.
