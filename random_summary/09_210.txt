this is just a special case of the general proposition that procedural fairness does not require the decision-maker, in this case the tribunal, to invite comment upon its thought processes on the way to its decision.
the rrt failed to consider the dangers of the applicant if he returned to his home country.
the applicant contends that the tribunal, in its letter to him dated 3 january 2008, failed to state that it was relevant to the review that the applicant's short visit to pakistan before traveling to australia would be a reason for doubting that he engaged in homosexual activities in the uae and therefore a reason to disbelieve or doubt his claim to being a homosexual.
