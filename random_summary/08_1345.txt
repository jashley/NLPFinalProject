the appellant argued that the question of law was whether he had been denied procedural fairness by the refusal of the tribunal to adjourn the hearing of the application.
on the following day, 13 may 2005, the tribunal sent a fax to mr cook confirming that the directions hearing would proceed on 16 may 2005.
in the same fax mr cook indicated that it was difficult for mrs cook and he to attend the tribunal and in order to avoid the exhaustion of travel they would need to stay in melbourne for the purpose of the hearing and would be claiming their expenses in so doing.
