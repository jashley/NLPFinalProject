the first is that there is a break fee of up to $300,000 payable by people in the circumstances set forth in the scheme booklet.
one of the matters which the directors took into account in coming to the view that the break fee is not excessive is that the break fee which is payable constitutes a reasonable amount to compensate m2 for the costs and disbursements incurred directly or indirectly by m2, as a result of the transaction not being implemented.
the proxy deeds make provision for this.
