it follows that the reference to class in s 13(6) must be construed broadly as a reference to the type of work that was being performed by a seafarer at the time of incapacity.
the employment of the seafarer in the australian shipping industry 4 the evidence before the tribunal, to which it referred in its reasons, was to the effect that there are two segments of the australian shipping industry, being the blue water segment, consisting of the coastal cargo trade, which includes voyages to south east asia, on the one hand, and the offshore segment, consisting of gas and oil operations, on the other hand.
31 as a matter of principle, in determining whether the work is of a kind or type that is sufficiently similar, the tribunal ought to have regard to the context in which, and the conditions under which, work was performed by the seafarer and under which work is being performed by the putative class.
