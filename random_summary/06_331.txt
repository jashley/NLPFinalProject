4 that particular arrangement of understanding has been pleaded directly in paragraph 35(a) of the statement of claim: '35 in or about the period 1 november 2002 to 11 december 2002, mcdonald on behalf of auspine, bone on behalf of bone timber and mr daniel on behalf of jag timber made an arrangement or arrangements, alternatively arrived at an understanding or understandings, containing provisions including provisions that: (a) auspine, bone timber and jag timber would no longer provide estimating services without charge but would pass on to the customer any charges incurred at cost; ...' 5 the applicant now seeks to add a 35(c) in the following terms: 'in the alternative subparagraph (a) above auspine, bone timber and jag timber would no longer supply (or give a quotation for the supply of) timber for trusses and wall framing, where auspine, bone timber or jag timber obtained or provided estimation services in respect of that quotation or supply, for the same price as the price of that timber alone, but the price of that timber would be raised by the cost to auspine, bone timber or jag timber of the estimation services obtained or provided; and' 6 the proposed amended statement of claim contains further pleadings which adopt that arrangement or understanding in the body of the statement of claim.
in my opinion, the particulars do not support the proposed amendment.
3 the applicant, however, has sought to amend the statement of claim in other respects.
