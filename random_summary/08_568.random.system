the rollover was not available in the year of income and there would be a tax liability for the disposal of the asset in that year.
thus, a new fact arising after the original assessment, being the further transactions, may change the tax liability for that year; that new fact could occur more than four years later.
a condition for choosing such a rollover is that a rolled over option may not be exercised to acquire an asset that becomes trading stock upon acquisition.
