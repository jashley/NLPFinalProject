i certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice gordon.
here, too, cadbury makes no challenge based on confidentiality and i thus i need not and do not make any finding as to whether the accc's interview with hodgson had an element of confidentiality.
had the court not made a positive finding with respect to both in visy no 2 , it could not have upheld the claim.
