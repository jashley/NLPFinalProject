in relation to the second ground the federal magistrate held that just as a delegate's decision may put an appellant on notice of relevant issues, so too may the content of an earlier tribunal hearing conducted as part of the same review.
her honour found that the appellant's answers did amount to information, however the court took the view that these answers were considered information given by the appellant for the purpose of the review and were excluded from the obligation in s 424a due to s 424a(3)(b) of the act.
once the member embarks on the process of considering the material before the tribunal, including both the material provided originally by the applicant and the material emerging from the earlier hearing, the tribunal member's mind will begin to focus on reasons why he or she is not persuaded by the case that the applicant put.
