the court below correctly dismissed the application, for the reasons which it gave.
the tribunal found the applicant's claims to consist of vague and unsubstantiated assertions.
10 the tribunal was entitled to come to the decision it arrived at without serving a notice under s 424a(1) as its decision to reject the application was based, not on information given by the applicant, but rather, a lack of it.
