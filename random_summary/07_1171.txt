in addition, no question was raised concerning the appellant's absence during the course of the hearing before the federal magistrate.
moreover, insofar as the appellant alleges that the tribunal did not act logically or rationally in deciding the case, no information was given, no specifics were set out and no argument was put to the court to support this contention.
the matter that he raised on the hearing before me was a submission to the effect that he had not had an opportunity to have his case properly put before the tribunal, and that he was not present during at least part of the proceedings before the federal magistrate.
