one of the terms of the proposal being put forward involved a guarantee and indemnity by mr rose.
the guarantee and indemnity is curious in so far as it fails to identify sakkara capital and rmb by name.
(d) rmb and sakkara capital may exercise a power under or in respect of their second ranking registered mortgage and their second ranking fixed and floating charge without the prior written consent of bos if, and to the extent that, bos's first ranking registered mortgage and the second ranking securities in favour of rmb and sakkara capital do not create or evidence a security interest over the same property of moruben.
