in written submissions hfat conceded that there was no basis for an order against mr troy thomas.
) however i note that mr rhys thomas has been consistent, both in his written and oral evidence, in his denial of removing the hfat booking records from the hfat office.
i consider mr rhys thomas' evidence as to the reason he went to the hfat office --- namely to remove furniture and other material there following the request by mr mcsweeney --- reasonable and acceptable.
