now, something that was said -- i know it's several years ago and you can't recollect exactly what was said to you on the telephone from mr wieland, but something along the lines was said that the wieland slp 1100 was proven to be a reliable crusher?---correct.
given the importance of the dates upon which inspections did in fact occur, being evidence centrally relevant to when the slp 1100s were manufactured and were in fact in operation, it is considered that those persons who in fact completed the inspection reports (or at least perhaps one of them) could have shed light on the matter and would have been expected to have done so: cf rps v the queen [2000] hca 3 at [25] , [2000] hca 3 ; 199 clr 620 at 632 per gaudron acj, gummow, kirby and hayne jj.
the machine which was sold to the austrian purchaser was initially said by mr wieland to have had the serial number 001 affixed; but that was a proposition he later abandoned.
