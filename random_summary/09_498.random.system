those issues can be summarised as follows: was the jurisdiction of the court to make an order as to third party costs exhausted once orders as to costs against the applicants were made and entered?
(at 451) i consider that it is appropriate to consider any potential liability of mrs tracy in terms of principles arising from cases where the courts have considered the exercise of the discretion to award costs against a non-party.
the fact that the applicants were unsuccessful with respect to their claims against the first and second respondents (other than with respect to a number of reserved costs) is irrelevant in the context of this notice of motion.
