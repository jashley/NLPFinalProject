i should note that it was part of remington's case, in resisting the making of the supplemental order, that when i declined to make order 11 on 14 december 2007, there was evidence before the court (from energizer) that it could take more than six months, and in some cases up to a year after launch, for old stock to be sold through at retail outlets.
however, i had also formed the preliminary view that the form of advertising and promotion actually used by the respondent to convey the comparative performance of its batteries was misleading and deceptive.
his honour: well, i understand what you're saying, mr bannon, but i think in the circumstances, having regard to the difficulties referred to in earlier evidence having regard to the time of year and the time at which these proceedings were brought, i won't make an order along the lines of order (11) in the short minutes that you have handed up this morning, namely the order relating to the over-sticking of stock in store.
