the defendant's own acknowledgment was that it encouraged departure from a price if necessary to secure a sale, and obviously its sales personnel would accept a sale at higher than the sale price during the sale period if a potential purchaser was unaware of the sale price.
there were 21 sales above $169: $244, $230 to $220 (four sales), $210 to $200 (five sales), and $170 to $195 (11 sales).
there were also six sales at less than $775, the lowest of which was at $581.
