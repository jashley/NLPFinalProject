the appellant sought judicial review of the tribunal's decision in the federal magistrates' court.
his honour noted that no complaint was directed to the translation provided at the second hearing and that, at that hearing, the appellant had had the opportunity of telling the tribunal about any material errors which had occurred at the first hearing.
he contended that the tribunal had been reconstituted "against the system" and that the interpreter had failed to interpret his claims correctly and "suppressed" him from speaking.
