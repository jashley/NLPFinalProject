at that time irene was living at hopevale with mr ludwick and a number of children.
i will refer to that department as the "lands department" and to the relevant minister as the "minister for lands".
alternatively, mr ludwick claims a licence pursuant to s 452a of the land act 1994 (qld) (the " land act 1994 ") which provides: land granted for aboriginal or islander inhabitants (1) any person who, at the time when land was granted in trust under the repealed act for the benefit of aboriginal or islander inhabitants, occupies any building or structure as the person's residence, as an authorised resident on the land, shall, notwithstanding the grant in trust, be entitled to continue the person's occupation of the building or structure upon the same terms and conditions as the person occupied it at the time of the grant until- (a) the trustee of the land determines otherwise and terminates the person's right to occupy the building or structure; or (b) the trustee of the land and that person agree to new terms and conditions for the person's occupation of the building or structure.
