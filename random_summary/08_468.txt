it may be that the statute will simply operate.
it seems to me in those circumstances that there is a case for saying that the second defendant, who chose to defend and failed, must bear a significant burden of costs.
however, i think, in a practical sense, it can be said that, leaving aside any default on the part of the second defendant, the third and fourth defendants probably are primarily responsible for the defects which led to the order being made.
