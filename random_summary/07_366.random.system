i have decided that a special order will be made as to costs, although there will not be the grant of indemnity costs as such.
on the other hand, i am not satisfied that it is necessary to make an order for indemnity costs.
the respondents/cross-claimants, csr limited and csr building products limited (together csr), seek costs on an indemnity basis.
