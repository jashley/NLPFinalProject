mr bertram has deposed to investigations which have already been undertaken by asic in relation to the affairs of firepower bvi.
these matters include whether there were breaches of director's duties and whether mr johnston was involved in permitting the company to trade whilst insolvent.
as to the report, it is sufficient for me to observe that the liquidator states that there are serious matters which warrant further investigation affecting mr johnston and other persons who acted as directors, or as de facto directors, of that company.
