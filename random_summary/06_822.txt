particular reliance was placed by lindsay on subpar (c) of that paragraph 5 of item 18.
72 in so far as item 36 is intended to operate in relation to '[g]oods... for use by a person... mainly in carrying out one or more activities described in subitem (1) of exemption item... 18... on behalf of one or more persons (the principals )', that is to say, activity as a subcontractor, it is unnecessary that the subcontractor/exemption user be 'a registered person at the time specified in the table in section 5'.
23 given that lindsay's submissions are sustainable in relation to the relevant goods, lindsay became entitled to a sales tax credit pursuant to s 51 and credit ground cr 2a of table 3 of schedule 1 to the tax act in respect of the sales tax it has borne, to the extent to which lindsay had not passed on the tax (as to disentitlement if tax was 'passed... on', see again column [4] to table 3 earlier extracted).
