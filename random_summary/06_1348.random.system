equally, when the commissioner made certain decisions about inmate access to personal computers this was done under cl 60 of the crimes (administration of sentences) regulation 2001 (nsw), which regulations were made pursuant to s 79 of the crimes (administration of sentences) act 1999 (nsw) .
the first is the commonwealth of australia; the second, the human rights and equal opportunity commission ("hreoc"); the third, the commonwealth ombudsman; the fourth, the new south wales ombudsman; the fifth, the commissioner of corrective services (nsw); and the sixth, the geo group australia pty ltd, a company contracted to conduct the day-to-day running of the junee correctional centre, a state prison at which a portion of mr clarkson's sentence was served.
the eight "decisions" alleged to have been made by this respondent replicate the decisions made against the commonwealth and the commissioner, save that they are adapted to take account of the fact that, as the body actually conducting junee correctional centre, its decisions were simply management decisions.
