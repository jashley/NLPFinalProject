the acc's application to re-open, made during the hearing, was withdrawn in the face of ss's objection and my indication that an explanation for the late production would be required.
the acc submitted that in producing the document it was acting consistently with its continuing discovery obligations (which i accepted in my principal reasons at [145]).
ss's objection was based not only on lateness, but also on serious allegations lacking any factual foundation (which i also accepted at [147]).
