i am of opinion that s 44(5) does not permit wright designed to claim falsely in the petition that it holds no security and, if that is proved wrong, to turn around and say that it could present the petition anyway without having voluntarily offered, under s 44(3) , to surrender the security for the benefit of creditors generally.
the person lawfully entitled to collect the judgment debts, namely wright designed, through its deed administrator, is entitled to rely on those judgments.
if wright designed, which was legally represented, could amend and reopen, then, in the interests of justice, mr and mrs mcclymont could also seek to do so to supplement their evidence on solvency.
