i further wish to emphasise that indigious fijians are quite united with their hate against indians and only for that reason thereis a cry "indians out" go back to india.
i am certain that if the tribunal has visited fiji or would have lived there that one will know the true story all these reports are relying upon from the fiji government and let me assure you that none of the government on this planet will ever say negative things about their government or their policies and am certain that this tribunal will agree with me on this.
i have recently noted that few indigious fijans has been detained by the fiji authorities because in jail certain peoples were planning another coupe which means situation in fiji is very instable like it has been always please sympathetically consider' 6 the breach of s 424a was that the tribunal utilised information from the department of immigration's movement database as to the appellants' various visits to australia.
