i am of opinion that a trustee in bankruptcy is an officer of the court.
this tax liability would fall on the (now discharged) bankrupt, with the real possibility that he would be unable to meet it.
&#8226; by virtue of s 58(1)(b) of the bankruptcy act , the bankrupt's interest in the deceased's estate is an interest which vests in the trustees as after acquired property.
