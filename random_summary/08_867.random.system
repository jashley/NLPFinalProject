thus, since december 2007 the city grill room has traded under the name squires loft city grill room.
quite apart from the fact that it seeks to impose a condition upon a licence that sundberg j found to be unconditional, it is far too late in the day (as well as impermissible in point of law) to contend for the existence of a conditional licence when the nature of that licence has been settled in another action.
the right it records is a right to "operate" the restaurant using the squires loft mark.
