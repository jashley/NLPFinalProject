mr castle, who appeared with mr pike for telstra , submits that the documents sought by the notice to produce are not likely to be useful in the proceedings.
no issue of oppression has been raised by telstra .
he says that: &#8226; the court could not conclude from the documents alone that any synergies or any internal modelling of those synergies by telstra, would have actually been realised had the transactions been consummated; &#8226; if the modelling is to be meaningful, the court will need to consider evidence about the assumptions used in preparing the models or in making predictions; &#8226; the probative value of the documents is likely to be diminished, since the court will not know whether the models and predictions were final or merely constituted intermediate working drafts; and &#8226; in any event, there is nothing to indicate that the circumstances of telstra corresponded to those that would be experienced by seven in the hypothetical circumstances that need to be explored in the damages aspect of the case.
