by para 29 of the amended statement of claim, the trustees plead that but for the 1997 transactions and the 1999 transaction, the estate of each bankrupt would have included a one-half legal and beneficial interest in the caloundra property.
in addition, the assertion that the transfers in december 1996 were part of the identified scheme implemented with a fraudulent intent may be relied upon if proved as part of the factual matrix going to the pleaded main purpose.
67 waters could not seriously be in any doubt that the trustees say these odd transfers between waters and the trustees of the trusts in the events described were consciously put in place to defraud present or future creditors and the main purpose of waters in entering into the 10 flexiphone transfers between them and dalvella was, as to the gifts back of $2.2m, to prevent those monies remaining available to any present or future creditors of waters or to hinder or delay the process by which those monies would become available to creditors.
