whether or not this is so, it does seem to me that this is a case which calls out for an urgent hearing.
moreover, it seems to me that the practical course is to allow the appeal because the matter cannot be distinguished from the decision of the full court in szkkc .
however, plainly enough, i am bound by the decision of the full court unless and until it is overturned by the high court.
