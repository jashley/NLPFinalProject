that line has been well and truly crossed by cadbury in the present case.
cadbury filed much evidence well after the date fixed by the court's directions; 5.
but at an earlier stage of its defence darrell lea pleads (par 14 (a)) that since at least 1954 it has sold a variety of chocolate and confectionary products "packaged in purple coloured wrapping" and (par 14(b)) that since about early 1962 it has "adopted the use of a shade of purple known as 'boysenberry'" on signage and colour schemes in retail outlets, point of sale material, wrapping paper etc. 17 on the face of the pleadings, and notwithstanding par 29 of the defence, it might appear darrell lea is admitting that it has been using a purple that is not different from "cadbury purple", or is substantially similar to "cadbury purple".
