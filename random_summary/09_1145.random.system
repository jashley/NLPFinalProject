while i think it is fair to say, as the counsel for the applicant submits, that it is necessary to read each of the particulars in the context of the whole and it is artificial to take each subparagraph and analyse it deeply, more work is still required in the presentation of those particulars to ensure that the particulars are properly linked and sheeted back to the primary oppression plea made.
in this case, counsel submitted that material facts were pleaded to show that the respondents knew that by accepting the proposal they were participating in something that breached the directors' duties; this could be illustrated in the negative, "on what basis did they think they could take up an offer, when it was clearly stated to be only made available to existing shareholders?".
the applicants thus submit that the facts surrounding the resolution of 26 may 2007 show an intent to issue shares at less than true value.
