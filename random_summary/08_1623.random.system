at all material times: 6.1 there was and is a demand, from members of the public seeking to choose and acquire loan products, for loan arrangement services in australia or, alternatively, in queensland; and 6.2 loan arrangement services are and were supplied by, inter alia, brokers and loan providers, including anz 7.
the reaction, as pleaded, was the withdrawal of accreditation and re-accreditation on terms which involved the price of a service provided by mrpl.
it is however important to start at the centre and work outwards by identifying the services which are the subject of one or more markets, the core or emblematic participants in the contended markets for those services (i.e., the core or essential suppliers of the identified services; and the class of acquirers of the service (potential residential home loan borrowers seeking the relevant related services)), the services in fact provided by mrpl and those services in fact supplied by anz and the material facts which demonstrate that those services are strong substitutes thus falling within a separate market.
