after reviewing the statutory provisions, the submissions of the parties, the decisions to which the parties referred and various definitions of "settle" and "settlement", the tribunal found against mr kezchek in the following terms: [ 32 ] in my opinion, taking into account the statutory history of s 17(3) and its purpose as discussed by von doussa j in banks and referred to by gray j in singh , and the definitions to which i have been referred, the words "settlement" and "settled" in s 17(3)(i) and (ii) refer to agreement negotiated between the parties resolving a claim or dispute.
this is in my view is consistent with the statutory scheme of s 17(3).
accordingly, there would be no utility in the making of any order in mr kezchek's favour even if the tribunal had taken into account an irrelevant consideration.
