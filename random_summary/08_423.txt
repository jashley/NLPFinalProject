counsel for capital, mr tottle, urges me to take into account that capital was close to being ready for trial and it has spent in excess of $300,000 on its own solicitor/client costs both in these proceedings and in connected proceedings such as a full court appeal and an application for special leave to the high court.
i reiterate that i am unable to draw any conclusion that the failure to meet the security for costs order is a contumelious disregard of the orders.
27 finally adultshop sought costs on an indemnity basis and/or to be paid forthwith.
