the court may do so if it is convinced that, in its earlier consideration of the point, it has proceeded "on a misapprehension as to the facts or law", where "there is some matter calling for review" or where "the interests of justice so require".
in view of the material before the court, i was prepared to decide this matter on the merits of the material before me.
in that case, i dismissed an appeal by the appellant against the decision of emmett fm of 14 march 2007 which had, in turn, dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal of 29 august 2005 and handed down on 20 september 2005.
