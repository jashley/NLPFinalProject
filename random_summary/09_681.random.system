as was then accepted, if such proceedings were brought, a different question might have arisen as to whether they should have been stayed so that a like claim could be made in the arbitration.
on 5 december 2003, the first respondent maintained its position that any potential claims under the tp act ought to be brought within the arbitration, and that the request for documents sought also be dealt with in the arbitration.
the fact that the arbitration was then on foot, and that any contemplated claims under the tp act against the first respondent might have been (and were) brought within the arbitration does not diminish that entitlement.
