19 here, however, visy was under no constraint as to the purposes for which it could use the witness proofs filed and later served on visy by the accc.
in my view, the confidentiality and free-rider arguments ostensibly advanced here by the accc are, at best, a proxy for that concern, and at worst a smokescreen obscuring it.
thus, it is necessary to posit a limited waiver, within a broad framework of the conduct of proceedings, which may bring about the result (as in austress ) that it is in the other side's power to destroy the privilege entirely by putting the statement or affidavit into evidence or examining or cross-examining on its contents.
