the step 4 amount is calculated "by adding up the amounts of each thing (an accounting liability ) that, in accordance with accounting standards, or statements of accounting concepts made by the australian accounting standards board, is a liability of the leaving entity at the leaving time that can or must be identified in the entity's statement of financial position" (s 711- 45 (1); emphasis added); and (5) step 5 --- if the amount remaining after step 4 is positive, it is the old group's allocable cost amount for the leaving entity.
note: the reasons for preserving this alignment are set out in subsection 705-10(3).
