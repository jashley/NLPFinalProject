i am satisfied that no concluded agreement for the sale of the coslovich interest was reached.
she described what happened at the mediation as follows: [counsel said that the bookers wanted] ... a list of creditors, a current profit &amp; loss and balance sheet to be provided.
according to mrs coslovich, mr booker's performance was so poor she was forced to appoint a "national sales manager" (whose appointment has since ended) in order to protect the interests of yrtb, bbpl and the franchisees.
