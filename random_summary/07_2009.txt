the present application for leave to appeal arises under s 158(2) of the patents act 1990 (cth).
the principles to govern consideration whether leave should be granted in a case such as the present were recently stated by a full court of this court in pfizer corporation v commissioner for patents [2006] fcafc 190 ; (2006) 155 fcr 578, especially at paragraphs [7] to [12].
the effect of such amendments would be to significantly narrow the scope of the claims.
