but, as i say, it is not the case here that the applicants made a deliberate tactical decision to plead their case in a particular way from the outset.
however, in the further amended defence filed pursuant to leave which i granted on 18 september 2009, that admission was withdrawn and instead optus admitted that it had sent the said text message on 25 december 2008.
as a result of obtaining those precise details, the applicants say that they were instructed to seek leave to amend the claim so as to plead a series of representations that optus is said to have made directly to the applicants, which representations are claimed to be misleading and deceptive.
