she submitted, however, that if one looks at the whole of the facts of the case, as the federal magistrate did, there was nothing useful that the applicant could have said, even if he had been given an opportunity to do so.
in support of his application, and pursuant to r 44.05(2) of the rules, the applicant filed an affidavit which said virtually nothing of substance about his complaint concerning the tribunal's decision although it did assert two grounds.
since, however, r 44.11 does not mandate the immediate application of r 44.12 at the first court date but indeed contemplates the possibility of the provision of particulars (r 44.11(g)) and a separate show cause hearing at a future date (r 44.11(b)), it seems to me that to give such warning --- even if relatively informally (as in a letter) --- is not a burdensome task for the minister to undertake and may well be desirable.
