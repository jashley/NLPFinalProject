the motion is brought by the australian building and construction commissioner (commissioner) who seeks orders that he cease to be an intervener in the proceedings pursuant to order 6 r 9(b) of the federal court rules (rules) and that he be joined in the proceedings as second applicant pursuant to order 6 r 2 of the rules.
i do not regard the supposed delay on the part of the commissioner in bringing this motion as, in truth, delay at all.
the motion was foreshadowed in correspondence to the applicant's solicitors the following day and the motion was filed and served a few days later on 20 july 2009.
