1 this is an appeal from a decision of the administrative appeals tribunal in respect of a claim by the applicant for compensation for an employment-related injury made under the safety, rehabilitation and compensation act 1988 (cth) ('src act').
counsel for the respondent at the tribunal, mr polin, submitted at the outset of the hearing that the issue between the parties ' seemed to be simply a medical dispute between ... mr [sic] mcgill and dr maxwell and professor sambrook'.
his report stated: 'in the absence of any history of back injury during his cmf service i must conclude that mr nipperess' current symptoms are due to the natural progression of a pre-existing spinal condition, not apparently aggravated by the army service.
