if the respondents or some of them desire to raise this issue in the earlier proceeding then there are proper processes whereby that may be achieved and given that the issue has been raised at this stage the parties are free to take such steps as they are advised to protect their position, and in particular the first and second respondents may, if so advised, file and serve a notice of motion in the other proceeding designed to achieve the end that is sought.
the proper course is for an application to be made in the earlier proceeding if it is desired to have the injunctions that were granted varied or dissolved as a result of the alleged failure of the applicants to inform the court of matters which should have been placed before it at the time at which the injunctions were sought.
8 i will further direct that, on or before 14 march 2008, the applicants file and serve short submissions in support of the making of the orders appearing at paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the draft minutes of orders handed to the court on 29 february 2008.
