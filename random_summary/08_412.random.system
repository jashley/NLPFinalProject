i am not prepared to fashion a costs order in some different way in the present case with a view, if this is what would be involved, to enhancing mr pascoe's position or departing from what i understand to be the normal approach to these issues.
those criticisms, as submissions on mr pascoe's behalf have pointed out, did not relate to the conduct of the proceedings.
those costs will include the professional fees of the trustee as well as expenses and legal costs.
