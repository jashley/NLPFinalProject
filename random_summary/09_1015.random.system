on 10 april 1985, the applicant relying on s 141 of the conciliation and arbitration act obtained a rule nisi calling upon the respondents, being the six persons named as being present at the commencement of the meeting of the national executive committee of the union on 31 january 1985 to show cause on 19 april 1985 why orders should not be made that they perform and observe the rules of the union, including in respect of the publishing of the pamphlet out of the funds of the union.
all this, in my view, follows from the text of s 190 itself.
the applicant also contends that in determining whether the allegations of fact relied upon in the application offer the grounds for suspicion that there has been an irregularity, the court is entitled to have regard to the judgment of heenan j in cfmeu v kavanagh [2008] wasc 146 ; (2008) 175 ir 225 ( cfmeu v kavanagh ) and to his honour's description of and conclusions from the material in front of him, in particular that: based on this information and these observations, the applicant contends that the conduct of the cfmeu to allow mr reynolds as the incumbent in control of the cfmeu to use the property and resources of the cfmeu to promote mr reynolds' candidacy and to attack opposing candidates is a clear breach of s 190.
