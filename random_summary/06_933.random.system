i rejected the applicant's application for leave to serve a subpoena and ordered that the applicant not be permitted to take further interlocutory steps without leave of the court.
as mentioned earlier, the applicant finally produced in response to the subpoena a cd-rom which i am informed contained in the order of 10,000 pages of material.
but two situations are obvious candidates for the exercise of the power: cases in which the history of non-compliance by an applicant is such as to indicate an inability or unwillingness to cooperate with the court and the other party or parties in having the matter ready for trial within an acceptable period and cases --- whatever the applicant's state of mind or resources --- in which the non-compliance is continuing and occasioning unnecessary delay, expenses or other prejudice to the respondent.
