upon that basis i now proceed with my reasons for decision.
it is clear, at least on the evidence before me, that a psychiatric assessment was given by dr entwisle to lander and rogers lawyers, solicitors for moorfields community, who was the first defendant in the proceeding brought by ms bahonko in the county court of victoria.
if a stay is granted obviously it will affect the process by which the first and second respondents seek to have summary judgment and those matters will be stayed as well, as the whole proceeding being stayed itself.
