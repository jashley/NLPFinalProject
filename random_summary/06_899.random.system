18 this first ground was particularised in the amended notice of appeal in the following way: (i) the tribunal had relied (predominantly) upon old and outdated ici (published some five years prior to the date of decision) 'showing that courts in bangladesh are independent'; (ii) the tribunal specifically failed to have regard to more relevant and up to date information, e.g., us department of state report published march 2003.
however, many defendants either were too poor or, because of strict detention, were unable to obtain legal counsel and thereby moved [sic] the case beyond the magistrate level.
(iii) in response to the tribunal's question 'about the philosophy, goals, mandate, manifesto and objectives of the chatra league and awami league', the appellant, inter alia , said that it was about 'secularism', 'democracy', 'socialism' and 'nationalism'.
