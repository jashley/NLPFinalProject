6 for these reasons, in my opinion, this is not an appropriate case in which to grant leave to appeal.
i should say, however, that even if there were some basis for challenging that approach in principle, the difficulty faced by the applicant in his application for leave is that, even if the refusal of a stay is a decision for the purposes of s 44, it is a discretionary decision against which it is very difficult to mount any attack absent some fundamental error in the approach of the tribunal.
the application for leave to appeal is dismissed with costs.
