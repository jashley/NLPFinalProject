the tribunal dealt with the situation of practise in australia as follows: "given that there are no restrictions on falun gong in australia and that it is practised openly and freely at public sites in sydney and elsewhere i am not satisfied that there is a basis for concluding that the applicant has any deep or genuine commitment to the faith or that he would practise it in china but for the fact that to do so could expose him to severe punishment.
that is not the way the case was apparently presented by him.
the claim that is made is that the review was unfair as the applicant/appellant was refused an opportunity to provide further details about his breach of the one child policy.
