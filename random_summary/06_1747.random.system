2 section 1292(2)(d)(ii) of the corporations act relevantly provides that the board may, if it is satisfied that a person who is registered as a liquidator under the corporations act has failed to carry out or perform adequately and properly certain duties, by order, suspend for a specified period the registration of that person as a liquidator.
for example, an order that the obligations referred to in ss 1296(1)(a)and (b) be taken not to have arisen in relation to a particular decision would be an order affecting the operation of that decision.
if that happened before compliance with s 1296 , there could be no obligation to lodge a copy of a notice with asic or to publish a notice.
