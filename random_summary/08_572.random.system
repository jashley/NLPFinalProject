there is, however, a traditional way in which an advice on evidence is set out which it is wise to follow.
that may well be so, but it remains the duty of counsel who have the particular knowledge of the issues in the case and their plan in respect of cross-examination to appraise the court of their own estimate, if that differs from that which the court is prima facie disposed to fix.
that is relevant, in my opinion, in terms of the characterisation of the present application in relation to the leading of evidence from mr lorenz.
