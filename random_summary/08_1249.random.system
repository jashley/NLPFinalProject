but in my opinion there is no contrary indication in the award.
the dispute between the parties is this.
" the amount to be paid must, according to the award, "equal or exceed the total of all amounts that, if the employee's employment had continued until the end of the required period of notice, the employer would have become liable to pay to the employee because of the employment continuing during that period[;] that total must be calculated on the basis of ... the employee's ordinary hours of work (even if not standard hours) and ... the amounts ordinarily payable to the employee in respect of those hours including (for example) allowances, loading and penalties and ... any other amounts payable under the employee's contract of employment.
