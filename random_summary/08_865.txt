in relation to more substantial prejudice, mr looney drew my attention to affidavits of mr paul jeynes, director of the respondent, sworn 19 november 2007 and 4 june 2008, where mr jeynes deposed, inter alia : &#8226; he had received telephone calls in february 2008 from two customers of the respondent informing him that they had been told by the applicant that the respondent's product is ineffective, and that the applicant had brought an action against the respondent, however mr jeynes was able to convince the customers that there was no substance to the applicant's allegations.
an order in such terms flows from the further amendments to the amended statement of claim.
in my view, the ordinary rule as to costs should apply in relation to vacation of the trial dates.
