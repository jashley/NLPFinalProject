asic contends that the transcript of the interviews set out substantially what is recorded on these tapes although in the case of the interview with mr noel anderson the transcript contains a part of the interview which does not appear to be included in the tapes.
asic has maintained a claim for public interest immunity over parts of those documents.
on 30 june 2009 the applicants asked me to determine any claim by asic for public interest immunity in respect of the documents produced by kpmg under the subpoena addressed to it at the same time as i determined the claim in respect of the documents produced by asic.
