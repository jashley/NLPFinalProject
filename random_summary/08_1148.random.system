further material filed in support of, and in opposition to, the interlocutory process (which it is unnecessary to enlarge upon here) suggests that there is a significant and genuine dispute between the parties in relation to the debt.
undoubtedly a serious dispute exists between the parties and on substantial grounds, as to mr gryst's claims and dromana's offsetting claim against him.
i mean no disrespect in not outlining those submissions here.
