in any event, it was accepted in argument that the notice was issued because the "al messilah" was not constructed in accordance with o 12.2 and s 6.6 of annexure 4 of the marine orders in that it did not have a treatment system or holding tank of the kind specified in s 6.6 of appendix 4 of the marine orders.
9 further, s 257 of the act gives the power to make regulations in relation to the loading, stowing or carriage of cargo.
