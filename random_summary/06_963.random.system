i certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice tamberlin.
he submitted that he feared being returned to punjab because he would be accused of having connections with pakistan due to his long absence from india, and he said that he may be detained and tortured.
11 in my view, having regard to a fair reading of the reasons of the tribunal read as a whole, i am satisfied that the question now sought to be raised in relation to imputed connections with pakistan was adequately dealt with by the tribunal.
