more to the point, neither identifies any error by the federal magistrates court in declining the application to extend time to enable an application to be made.
this is an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal against a judgment of the federal magistrates court given on 18 may 2009 ( szjtw &amp; anor v minister for immigration &amp; anor [2009] fmca 508).
the court may extend time "for special reasons" under order 52 r 15(2).
