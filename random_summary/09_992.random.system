i appreciate that a solicitor represented the applicant at the tribunal.
(j) the letter from walker &amp; company in july 2004 indicating the rent payments were interest on a loan from ms yu-lin.
on balance, i am satisfied that the applicant has not discharged the required onus of proof that she was not the beneficial owner of the property during the relevant period and that the amended assessments were excessive .
