6 the accc opposes the grant of leave largely on the basis of what it asserts is (i) the unsatisfactory nature of the affidavit put on by mr lancsar's legal adviser to explain the reasons why leave is sought; and (ii) correspondence between its own lawyers and mr lancsar's legal adviser concerning the admissions generally made by mr lancsar.
as to the latter, the burden of the letter to mr lancsar's lawyers, having acknowledged that he had admitted generally the substance of the factual matters alleged by the accc, sought to enquire whether he was interested in cooperating with the accc with a prospect of the action being discontinued against him (although the letter did point out it had no instructions in relation to offering him a client cooperation agreement).
7 in my view it is unsurprising no such reference was made.
