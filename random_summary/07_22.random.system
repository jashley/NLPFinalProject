the first directions hearing of the applicants' application took place in adelaide.
order 10, referring to the court's powers at a directions hearing, apparently uses the term "hearing" in r 1(2)(c) in a somewhat more confined sense as a hearing in which the court proposes to perform an adjudicative function (not necessarily a final adjudication).
the hearing to which o 53 r 1 refers is that of the matter itself, and not a particular issue or issues, or a particular step or steps in the process.
