4 in forming a view about where the balance in those competing interests might lie, i formed the view that it would be necessary to examine the documents carefully to be satisfied that a claim for public interest immunity was made out on the affidavit material.
additionally, the respondent makes a claim to withhold some material which, it seems to me, could not qualify for protection as sensitive information on the ground of public interest immunity going to a national threat to the public interest.
3 accordingly, i elected to look at those documents accepted by the respondent as relevant to the issues in the proceeding before me on wednesday, 22 march 2006 and assess whether, with the benefit of that examination, the public interest in ensuring access to the documents so as to enable the applicant to properly conduct its case outweighed the public interest in preventing damage or harm to the national interest which might be occasioned by disclosure of the documents.
