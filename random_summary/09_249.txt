according to the records analysed by ms kohary, units in the twentieth green unit trust and the rose anna unit trust were purchased by retail treasury not from money that came from it but rather from other companies in the dollarforce group.
on 26 february 2009 the commission filed a further amended originating process in which it applied to wind-up each of the third to tenth defendants and also applied for the appointment of a provisional liquidator of the third to tenth defendants.
there is a further issue which, in my view, warrants the appointment of a provisional liquidator to retail treasury.
