in my opinion, that is unlikely to be correct because of the way in which the tribunal expressed its reasons.
it may be inconsistent, for example, if there is delay on the part of the applicant or the applicant has waived or acquiesced in the invalidity of the decision or does not come with clean hands.
the appellant had the opportunity to put fully his case to the tribunal, in writing, in his application for review.
