mason j in the passage i have already quoted points out that the making of a previous decision by a judge on issues of fact and law, although perhaps generating an expectation of a particular outcome, does not mean that the judge will not be impartial and unprejudiced in the relevant sense.
43 in polites, the high court considered that the advice given by deputy president polites, when he was a solicitor, to the hoyts corporation pty ltd had variously: long since become irrelevant to the determination he had to make as a member of the full bench of the australian industrial relations commission (at 90); was uncontentious legal advice as to the jurisdiction of the commission (at 90); was not acted on in any event (at 91); or was advice on negotiating options available; that made no recommendation as to the wisdom, reasonableness or appropriateness of the course of action proposed (at 91).
23 in my view, these submissions give rise to one issue of substance, that is, whether by reason of the advice i gave in 1999 to the acd corporation, a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that i might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the issues i will be required to decide in the mirrar application.
