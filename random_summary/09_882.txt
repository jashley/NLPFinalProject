in relation to the assertion regarding country information, her honour noted that the tribunal did not refer to any country information, but rather was not satisfied that the appellant met the criteria for being a refugee based on his own evidence.
on 19 august 2009 the appellant returned the invitation form to the tribunal, having marked the box which indicated that he did not want to come to a hearing and consented to the tribunal proceeding to make a decision on review without taking further action to facilitate his appearance before it.
finally, her honour was satisfied that the tribunal accurately summarised the appellant's claims in its decision, and applied the appropriate principles in determining whether the appellant had well-founded fear of persecution for a convention reason.
