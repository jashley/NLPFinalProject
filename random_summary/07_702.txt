the appellant claimed to have started to attend a bible study group in april 2004 and in august 2004 the appellant was baptised.
the tribunal noted that the appellant had never attended a state-sanctioned church and therefore had no basis upon which to say that it would not meet her spiritual needs.
the applicant herself has never attended a state-sanctioned church and has no basis on which to say that it would not meet her spiritual needs (not that she claimed this), other than having been told by mrs wei that such churches are "very bad".
