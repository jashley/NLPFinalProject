section 66b of the native title act 1993 (cth) (the act), at the time of the application, provided: 66b replacing the applicant application to replace applicant in claimant application (1) one or more members of the native title claim group (the claim group ) in relation to a claimant application, or of the compensation claim group (also the claim group ) in relation to a compensation application, may apply to the federal court for an order that the member, or the members jointly, replace the current applicant for the application on the grounds that: (a) either: (i) the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it; or (ii) the current applicant has exceeded the authority given to him or her by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it; and (b) the member or members are authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it; court order (2) the court may make the order if it is satisfied that the grounds are established.
in those cases, the court will not be called upon to determine the s 84c application.
it is a natural use of language to designate the group of persons on whose behalf a claimant application is made, as 'a claim group', whether or not the application proves to be successful, and those persons, 'including the applicants', as 'claimants'.
