the second test in d&eacute;cor , whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong, is, in my view, not satisfied in this case.
the orders were made pursuant to rule 14.04 of the federal magistrates court rules 2001 and required the applicant for leave to produce to the federal magistrates court a number of documents relating to his financial and taxation affairs going back to 1 january 2006, as well as documents relating to his commencement of proceedings in courts and tribunals naming the commonwealth, or some other emanation of the commonwealth, as a respondent or defendant, as well as documents recording any costs orders made by any court or tribunal in such proceedings, and that the respondent be granted access to the documents produced.
the only material that i had before me were the terms of the actual orders themselves.
