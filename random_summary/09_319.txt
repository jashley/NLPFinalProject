other matters affecting the meeting remain somewhat speculative.
however, while the rules remain in their present form, i do not consider, putting to one side new rule 56, that they provide in the requisite sense for control of the com by the members.
alternatively, under rule 66(a)(i), the branch committee had a discretion to hold a plebiscite.
