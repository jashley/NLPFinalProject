(emphasis added) 24 paragraph 10.7 of the defence is as follows: 10.7 says further or alternatively that: 10.7.1 the matters pleaded in paragraphs 10.5 and 10.6 above caused the second respondent to assume that mr andony acted on mrs andony's behalf and with her authority with respect to all matters pleaded in paragraphs 41-43 soc; and 10.7.2 by reason of the performance of obligations pleaded in paragraph 10.6 and the benefit thereby conferred on mrs andony and the corresponding detriment that will be suffered by the second respondent if mrs andony resiles from the assumption that mr andony acted on her behalf and with her authority with respect to all matters pleaded in paragraphs 41-43 of soc mrs andon is estopped from denying that mr andony acted on her behalf and with her authority with respect to all matters pleaded in paragraphs 41-43 of soc.
paragraph 5 of the defence denies this allegation but then pleads that the consideration comprised the benefits accruing to the andonys under and pursuant to what are described as the first agreement or alternatively the november 2000 agreement.
in my opinion, the positive pleading constitutes material allegations and the court below was correct to order that particulars, in terms of those requested, be given.
