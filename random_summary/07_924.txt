by 11 october 1999, 17 july 2000 and 28 february 2003 the university was said, by sirtex, to have been put on inquiry as to information then publicly available on the database maintained by the australian commissioner of patents in reference to the names of bruce gray and paragon medical ltd (paragon medical) ([174]).
40 dr gray also complains that the university has given no evidence as to the delay in bringing on the non-responsive amendments.
it asserted that by dr gray's conduct in not complying with notification conditions under the patent and intellectual property regulations he impliedly represented that no patentable invention and no intellectual property likely to be commercially significant had been developed and/or discovered by him.
