i do not agree that mrs jensen sought, unsuccessfully, to have the proceedings transferred to the family court at the hearing of 31 march 2009 --- in fact although counsel for mrs jensen invited the court to make the order of its own initiative, no formal application for transfer was made.
mrs jensen was successful in her application for the proceedings to be transferred to the family court.
the only outstanding matter for decision at this stage relates to costs incurred in the following proceedings: an application by mrs jensen for a stay of the proceedings for abuse of process.
