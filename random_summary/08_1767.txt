the basis for that apprehension lies in the tribunal's disregard of the applicant's evidence that she attended the local church in sydney.
neither of those mistakes affected the analysis of the claims nor the conclusions reached especially in relation to the evidence analysed by the tribunal which, in its view, revealed inconsistencies of treatment calling into question the credit of the applicant.
the applicant claimed that her parents tried to persuade her to discontinue her involvement in the church and asked her brother in australia (among others) to arrange for her to go overseas in case she was in danger.
