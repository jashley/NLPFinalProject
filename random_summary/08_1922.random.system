the critical part of mr setter's affidavit sworn 10 february 2006 concerns a conversation said to have occurred in late october or early november 2002 as follows: 2... adams: "there is not a lot of grain left in northern new south wales.
in or about late october or early november 2002 the respondent, by the respondent's agent, in trade or commerce, made the following representations to the applicant: (a) the wheat harvest was going to be very small; (b) there was more demand for feed wheat than there was supply; (c) there was only 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes of wheat in northern nsw which had nearly all been purchased; (d) that if the applicant didn't buy at that time the applicant would be unable to purchase feed wheat until october 2003.
the conversation with mr rowland appears to involve the general availability of feed wheat.
