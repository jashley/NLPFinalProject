the respondent says that rectification of the gsa in this way would reflect the common intention of the parties that barton international would be obliged to cause bmc to abide by any provision of the gsa which imposed obligations as regards the sale or distribution of garnet acquired under the gsa, which common intention necessarily included the intention that rights conferred on barton international which were connected with fulfilment of obligations, would be exercisable by bmc.
the inclusion of this portion of cl 2.5 serves to emphasise that the obligation to brand is intended to arise at the point of marketing to customers.
the parties were very aware, and took advice during the negotiations of the principal agreement and the gsa to ensure there would be no settlement under which: (a) the market for distribution and sale of garnet was "carved up" by the parties (for example, by way of a provision which could preclude barton international from selling in australia), which would contravene s 45(2) and s 4d of the trade practices act 1974 ; (b) gma garnet's monopoly position in australia was used to curtail competition in australia, which might infringe s 46 of the trade practices act 1974 ; nor (c) barton international was offered a discount for garnet on terms that prevented it from distributing the garnet in a particular place, if the purpose or effect of the arrangement was to lessen the competition substantially in australia, which might contravene s 47(2)(c) and s 42(f)(ii) , s 47(10) of the trade practices act 1974 .
