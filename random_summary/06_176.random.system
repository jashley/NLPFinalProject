the view i have reached is that i should accord mzwmq the same authority and respect that i would accord other single judge decisions in this court, and that i should not depart from it unless i am satisfied that it was wrongly decided.
accordingly, i reject the appellant's claim that the tribunal erred in not giving particulars of the husband's evidence to the appellant in the manner contemplated by s 424a(1)(a).
the tribunal noted, however, that the appellant had never held an official position with the cyprus women's group and knew nothing about its affairs.
