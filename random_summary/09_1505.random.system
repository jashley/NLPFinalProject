shortly before the consent orders, mr wilkshire filed five new trade mark applications all similar in character to his original marks.
he has been unprepared to honour the undertaking he gave to the council not to initiate litigation in respect of its use of its registered mark.
having dismissed mr wilkshire's application, i will order that the he pay the second respondent's costs on an indemnity costs basis (including its costs of the motions of 19 june 2009 and of 21 september 2009).
