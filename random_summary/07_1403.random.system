since the commissioner of taxation has been successful in both applications, the order of the court will be that david james walters and rhondda isobel walters are to pay the costs of the commissioner of taxation of and incidental to each application.
because the parties had not made submissions in relation to costs, the question of costs was reserved to be determined.
david walters and rhondda walters provided short submissions on 27 august 2007 and the commissioner of taxation provided short written submissions on 3 september 2007.
