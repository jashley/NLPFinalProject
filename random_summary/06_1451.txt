4 paragraph (d) is a coverall and i do not think anything is gained from that category.
although i do not equate the recommender with the decision-maker in this case, it seems to me that the specific reference to that material which was before that party brings it within the penumbra which is reasonably producible on discovery.
2 as regards the documents referred to in paragraph 1(a), in my view, the recommendation which went to the decision-maker expressly referred to and identified the particular reports concerned.
