2 the orders made in this matter ( duus v dalvella ) relate to orders consequent upon an independent application for leave to extend time for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment.
the applicants for leave have failed to comply with the rules and seek to make out special grounds for leave.
accordingly, i make a further order that the costs of the interlocutory proceeding shall be costs which the party having the benefit of that order is entitled to pursue and i give leave to deliver a bill of costs immediately.
