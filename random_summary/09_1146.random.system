double standard under the heading "magistrate double standard" the applicant outlines in his affidavit sworn 23 july 2009 that "the appellant did not respond to the respondent letter about which plan would be used (in the expert witness statement) because the answer was obvious magistrate made an order that the appellant provide the drawings and gave him notice of 24 hours to produce these drawings".
the applicant spoke briefly at the hearing and, at his request, the court granted him leave to file additional written submissions.
at [2] , his honour outlined that he was of the view that the court had no power to grant the application: the court having examined the provisions of the federal magistrates act 1999 (cth) and the federal magistrate court rules 2001 (cth) and having sought from the applicant an indication as to what provisions of the fm act or fmc rules he relies upon in relation to the application for leave to appeal the judgment of 10 july 2009 and receiving no indication that there were any relevant provisions from the applicant and on its own inquiries not being able to find any provisions of the fm act or the fmc rules which give it power to grant leave to appeal an interlocutory judgment, is of the view that it has no power to grant the application by mr ibrahim....this court is not a court of inherent jurisdiction, it is a court of statutory jurisdiction.
