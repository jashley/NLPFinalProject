the liquidators have estimated the length of the hearing to be in the region of five to six months of court time including the hearing of mr selim's cross-claims.
the reasons, which i have referred to above, point in favour of that condition being satisfied.
57 in summary, i think it is sufficient to say that disclosure of the pertinent provisions of mr mcgrath's affidavit which exposed his reasoning process would seriously prejudice the liquidators in the event that mr selim and the commonwealth have access to the views which mr mcgrath has expressed in his affidavit.
