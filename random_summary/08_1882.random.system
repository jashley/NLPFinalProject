in the absence of the applicant attending a hearing and giving direct evidence, i am unable to resolve these inconsistencies.
the primary judge found that, at most, the migration agent failed to inform the applicant of correspondence from the tribunal inviting the appellant to attend the hearing.
this appeal ground was particularised as follows: - (i) the migration agent failed to include details of the appellant's persecution in his original application for a protection visa, (ii) the appellant's application to the tribunal lodged by the migration agent contained serious errors, and (iii) the migration agent failed to inform the appellant of the progress of his application, the decision of the minister's delegate, or the tribunal's invitation to attend a hearing.
