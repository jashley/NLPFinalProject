mr hourigan's letter stated that a deal had been reached between the libraries board and the public trustee.
the effect of the deed, so far as larrikin was concerned, was that the libraries board assigned the copyright in "kookaburra" to larrikin, in lieu of the previous assignment from the public trustee.
the essence of the argument of the composers and emi was that ms sinclair was aware of the rules and accepted them by conduct in submitting the manuscript of "kookaburra" as her entry.
