the court orders that: 1.
it is not immediately clear to me that conduct of the first respondent which his honour found was harassment of the appellant in the context of her wish to form a relationship with him, was not, in the absence of a hearing where relevant evidence and legal principles were considered, "unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed".
there is no claim in his material, however, that the first respondent subjected him to an unwelcome sexual advance or made to him an unwelcome request for sexual favours.
