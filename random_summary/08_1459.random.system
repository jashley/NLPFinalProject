in summary, he said he feared persecution at the hands of the maoists because of, firstly, his refusal to pay the extortion demand made by maoists in 2004, secondly, his perceived links with the monarchy as a result of his former position of ward chairman (for six months in 2003-2004) and thirdly, because of his position with amnesty international.
applying the approach of mchugh j in ex parte cohen , her honour found that the question that the tribunal had to decide in this case was whether the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution by maoists if he returned to nepal.
