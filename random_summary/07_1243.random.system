in the result, merkel j ordered that the applicant file and serve a further amended statement of claim on or before 17 march 2006 (ie that day).
it is not obvious to me that, before the trial started, the applicant herself was in a position to make such an assessment, even if she should otherwise be regarded as capable of seeing the matter in an objective light.
however, on 22 november 2005, the respondents informed the applicant that the amended statement of claim did not disclose a cause of action, and drew attention to the absence of any pleaded facts "linking or showing a causation" between the temporary illness of the applicant and the "alleged" termination of her employment.
