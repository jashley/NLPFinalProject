8 settlement of the purchase contract occurred on 25 october 2000 and the transfer was registered under the transfer of land act 1958 (vic) on 9 november 2000.
... the respondent submitted that the gst act is not concerned with whether property in land is a matter of physical fact or abstract right but rather with supplies as business transactions "made in the course or furtherance of an enterprise that you carry on"; s 9-5.
section 75-15 is not dealing with the situation that has arisen here nor, in my view, does it assist in the determination of the issue here.
