in my opinion, it was certainly open to the tribunal to have formed the view in the present case, that it would not be appropriate for it to exercise its power to ask questions of witnesses by telephone, in the absence of a witness statement or other indicator of the nature of the evidence which it was suggested it could obtain from the proposed witnesses.
it also implicitly explains why it did not feel it necessary to inquire further into what additional evidence might be given by the proposed witnesses.
for these reasons i am satisfied that the appellant has not demonstrated any error in the reasoning of the federal magistrate.
