i certify that the preceding three (3) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice tamberlin.
i have also had regard to the correspondence and emails in the history of the proceeding and, having considered the affidavits that are before me, i consider it appropriate to make orders in terms of the short minutes of order.
in reaching this conclusion, i have taken into account the fact that substantial costs have been incurred and will be the liability of the respondents under the orders.
