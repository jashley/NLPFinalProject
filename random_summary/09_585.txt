i have read the primary judge's reasons for finding the applicant guilty of contempt, the proposed grounds of appeal and the outline of submissions filed by the respondent.
in my opinion, an extension of time should be granted and the order of the court is as follows: the time within which the applicant may file and serve a notice of appeal appealing against the declarations made by lander j on 16 april 2009 (order number 7) and containing the 25 grounds of appeal identified in exhibit "gft-b" to the applicant's affidavit sworn on 20 may 2009 be extended to 9 june 2009.
i will hear the parties as to costs and any other orders.
