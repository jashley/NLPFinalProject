2 as to the orders to be made, i should indicate that i intend to dismiss the amended application (which sought relief in respect of restraints of trade at common law) for the reason that, by virtue of s 4m of the trade practices act 1976 (cth), the law relating to restraint of trade at common law was, in the circumstances, not capable of operating concurrently with s 87(3) of the tp act, which was invoked by the first, fourth, seventh and eighth respondents ("the respondents") in their cross-claim of 2007.
