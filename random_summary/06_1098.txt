as noted above, with the exception of the small number of esop options, all the options are presently exercisable without condition, so that there is equality of treatment between option holders and shareholders, subject to the relatively inconsequential and slightly advantageous treatment of the esop option holders.
subject to the qualification referred to below, each member of rocksoft will receive $1 for each share held, and each option holder will receive for each option held in respect of rocksoft $1 less the amount required to exercise the option.
there will also be an order that rocksoft be exempt from complying with s 411(11) of the act.
