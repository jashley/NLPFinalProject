the applicant seeks leave to file and serve a notice of appeal from a judgment of the federal magistrates court given on 6 february 2009 ( szhlw v minister for immigration and citizenship &amp; anor [2009] fmca 51).
because the notice of appeal was not filed and served within 21 days as required by order 52 r 15 of the federal court rules , the application for the extension of time is required.
in circumstances where the applicant has sought an indulgence of the court by way of an extension of time to file and serve the notice of appeal, i am be satisfied that the applicant has failed to prosecute the proceeding with due diligence by failing to attend the court on the date allocated for the hearing of the application.
