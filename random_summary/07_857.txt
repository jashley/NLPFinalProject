geelong school supplies pty ltd (gss) and landmark school supplies pty ltd (landmark) have brought an action (proceeding vid 691 of 2006) against two of gss' directors, mr and mrs dean, their company dean school supplies pty ltd and several other defendants.
one of the actions (proceeding vid 718 of 2006), which i might describe as a parallel proceeding, is brought by landmark against substantially the same defendants as in the principal action (vid 690 of 2006).
conversely if the claim by landmark fails, it is difficult to see how the action by gss could succeed having regard to the almost complete overlap of the allegations against the defendants.
