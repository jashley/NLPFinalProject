after my decision in awb limited v honourable terence rhoderic hudson cole [2006] fca 571 , awb determined that a claim for privilege could not be maintained over the documents.
4 in correspondence and other exchanges between awb's solicitors and the inquiry this week, the inquiry told awb on several occasions that it intends to publish the documents.
the terms of reference of the inquiry also contemplate that the first respondent will take steps to protect the confidentiality of documents where it is appropriate to do so.
