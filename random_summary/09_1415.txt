this would be very bad for both of us.
mr carroll did not have reasonable grounds to expect, nor did he expect, that the company was solvent throughout the relevant period, and would remain solvent even if it incurred the debts it did incur during the relevant period.
the plan was that the company would purchase plant and equipment to enable it to kiln dry and machine its own timber rather than be limited to on-selling green rough cut boards.
