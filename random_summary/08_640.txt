the language of the claims, it is said, together with a practical understanding of the function of the invention, demonstrates that the inclusion of an operative adjustment assembly is an additional and optional component of the wear assembly described in the claim, rather than an integral part of the rigid lock.
his interpretation of the phrase "opening extending therethrough" was largely one of subjective impression and, in my view, was shown to be weak.
it is not sufficient, it is said, for the lock to become rigid only after a variety of parts (including a nut, bolt, keeper plate, spring washer and nut washer assembly) have been assembled and tightened.
