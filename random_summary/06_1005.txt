18 as to the notion of serious hardship above addressed in filsell , the tribunal below drew attention to re wilson and minister for territories (1985) 7 ald 225, where deputy president hall discussed (at 229) the meaning of the similar notion of undue hardship, in the context of exercise of the statutory discretion of the minister to discharge a liability for payment of rates on the ground of undue hardship, being a meaning said by deputy president hall to connote something more severe than substantial hardship .
it was argued by the commissioner conversely that the factual circumstances of a high income earner having substantial assets, sufficient in value to meet all current liabilities, could not reasonably fall within the statutory notion of serious hardship .
moreover the commissioner pointed to patience on the commissioner's part in relation to the collection of mr milne's taxation indebtedness when agreeing to the settlement in september 2002, and recorded that mr milne did not put any further offer of compromise after the rejection by the commissioner of the offer made to mr milne in december 2003.
