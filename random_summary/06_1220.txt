' afma concluded the letter by drawing attention to mr rhodes' right to seek a review of its decision by the aat within 28 days, being a right of review which mr rhodes exercised by filing an application for review by the aat on 23 february 2004.
after those events had occurred, mr rhodes merely forwarded to afma a form of application for fishing permit, and did so without any tender of payment of fees.
afma disputed that any such policy as in (i) above was implemented in any event, and further that (ii) would have to be reformulated to read, 'whether the afma's cost recovery procedures were a relevant consideration to the decision whether to grant the [applicant] a new fishing permit', in order to be capable of raising a question of law.
