haviv and mr aghion also relied on a plaza document headed "items list [summary]" showing items, suppliers, the number of items on hand, their total value, their average cost, current price and the total current price.
i do not accept haviv's submission, based on mr hughes' evidence, that the inputs into this approach are inappropriately subjective.
this approach is consistent with principle (see amann aviation at 116).
