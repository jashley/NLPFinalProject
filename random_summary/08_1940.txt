if there was no rrt-reviewable decision, there was no "decision under review".
the applicant has not shown any error on the part of the federal magistrate nor has he shown that he has any prospects of success in an appeal from that decision.
in its decision dated 7 july 2008 ('the jurisdiction decision'), the tribunal (which i may also refer to as the third tribunal) held that it did not have jurisdiction to conduct a second review of the delegate's decision as that decision had already been the subject of a valid review by the tribunal and was no longer an rrt---reviewable decision under s 411 of the migration act 1958 (cth) ('the act').
