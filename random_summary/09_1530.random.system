the appellant contends that this fact at least should have been communicated to the appellant to afford him the opportunity to make further inquiries and, if necessary, adduce information or make further submissions on the point.
the hearing rule at common law imposes an obligation in terms that are more narrow, that is to say, a person affected by a proposed decision is entitled to be made aware of information available to the decision-maker that is adverse, credible, relevant, and is of significance to the decision, so that he or she can make submissions and rebut, qualify and/or comment on any such information: kioa v west [1985] hca 81 ; (1985) 159 clr 550 at 628-629.
counsel for the appellant also submitted that for the purposes of s 424a of the act, the relevant "information" that should have been put to the appellant for his further comment, and which was relied upon by the tribunal in whole or in part in making its decision, is to be identified by reference to the summary given by the tribunal of the information it received from the australian embassy.
