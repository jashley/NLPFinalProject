in february 2006 the respondent lodged an application for a further business visa in which she provided an address to which correspondence should be sent (the bridgewater way address).
on 24 march 2009 the department sent the respondent's solicitor a letter (the third notification letter) enclosing a letter to the respondent dated 23 march 2009 and the decision record dated 7 august 2007 by which the delegate refused her visa application.
the sequence of statutory and regulatory provisions to which we have referred prescribes with precision the steps to be taken in notifying a visa applicant of the outcome of his or her application.
