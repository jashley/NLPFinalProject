however, i do not agree that sentence can transmit, even with the aid of s 249f(2) , the same obligation in respect to shareholders convening a general meeting pursuant to s 249f(1).
it was stated that the expectation was that the meeting would be held in late january 2007.
there is, therefore, no evidence that the convening of the meeting by the defendants has any effect on restricting the ability of shareholders to vote on the resolutions at either of the general meetings.
