in so far as the applicant seeks to agitate the validity of any determination by the foreign minister under reg 2.43, the question is not justiciable and the applicant has no standing to impugn the validity of the determination on the grounds upon which she relies.
that is to say, in so far as the tribunal acted on the determination of 14 july 2008, it did so on the basis that, on 19 september 2008, the foreign minister had decided to affirm the determination and, on 27 january 2009, had decided not to revoke the determination.
following that exchange, a submission was made to the foreign minister on 23 may 2008 by officers of the foreign minister's department.
