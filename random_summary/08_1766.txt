33 the plaintiffs have not tendered any evidence to the effect that, if the final relief which they seek in respect of their complaint concerning the expenditure of the second defendant's funds on legal expenses is made good, the necessary financial adjustments are not likely to be effective.
23 the plaintiffs have established that the legal expenses of the first, second, fourth and fifth defendants are all being paid by the second defendant and that those expenses will continue to be paid by the second defendant unless interlocutory relief along the lines of that which is sought by the plaintiffs is granted.
25 in the present case, counsel for the first and second defendants and the buskens has submitted that the plaintiffs put a case which implicates the first and second defendants in the events and transactions about which complaint is made and that the buskens are not the sole or even the principal targets of the plaintiffs.
