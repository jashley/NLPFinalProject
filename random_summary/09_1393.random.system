decision on infringement the respondents who were represented at the hearing conceded that each of the respondents' heaters had: (a) a source of light; (b) simulated fuel means to simulate a bed of combusting fuel; (c) screen means on which one can observe an image of simulated flames, said screen means being positioned between said flame effect means and said simulated fuel means; and (d) the capability of producing images of flames on the said screen means which appear to emanate from the area between the simulated fuel means and an image of the simulated fuel means reflected in the screen means.
claims 1---14 and 20 are in the following terms: apparatus for simulating flames, the apparatus comprising a source of light, simulated flame effect means for reflecting said light to simulate flames, simulated fuel means to simulate a bed of combusting fuel, and screen means on which to view an image of the simulated flames, said screen means being positioned between said flame effect means and said simulated fuel means, said screen means being capable of diffusely transmitting light reflected by said flame effect means and also being capable of reflecting light from said simulated fuel means so that the simulated flames appear to emanate between the simulated fuel means and an image of the latter means reflected in said screen means.
those paragraphs are in the following terms: there is no real dispute between the parties as to the principles of construction to be applied in this matter although there is some difference in emphasis.
