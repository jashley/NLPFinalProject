the prima facie case asserted by the suzlon companies was further strengthened by the material indicating mr bangad's inability to explain to his employer his purposes for his entering into the impugned transactions and his inability, when confronted by mr den hartog, to explain why he had told mr den hartog that the suzlon and headway companies were associated, rather than at arms length, and why mr den hartog's letter accepting appointment as a director of headway shipping had been backdated.
