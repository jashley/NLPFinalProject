in para 9 of the affidavit, mr lee asked that the hearing scheduled for 14 april 2008 should be put off for at least five or six months, until october 2008 or thereafter.
i was unpersuaded by the comments made by [ mr lee ] yesterday as to his due application to the proper defence of this claim, and accordingly i made the order yesterday striking out the response defence and cross-claim that he has lodged.
the injustice concerned was identified at 549-550.
