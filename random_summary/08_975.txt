in those circumstances, i will adjourn this application to 24 july 2008 and will require that ukl write to each of the members, advising them of the new information.
the scheme was approved by the requisite number at the meeting of members held for that purpose on12 june 2008.
however, the evidence which has been adduced by ukl today does not satisfy me that this is a matter of such trivial consequence for the implementation of the scheme that i should approve the scheme without the matter first being disclosed to the members of ukl.
