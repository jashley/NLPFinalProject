i think the figure of $97,825.58 is simply the addition of the solicitor's professional fees and outlays, and the fees for senior and junior counsel, together with the costs of the assessment described as " anticipated " of the assessment, being a rounded figure of $3,000.00.
the total costs relating to the solicitor's professional fees and outlays, excluding the photocopying costs relating to the law reports for the court, have been delivered in the sum of $14,775.58.
i am further satisfied that in respect of both proceeding 69 of 2003, and proceedings 174 of 2004, there is a cross claim by the plaintiff against the defendant that exceeds the amount of the debt in the statutory demand.
