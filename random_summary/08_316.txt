in the affidavit of connie isaacs filed on 22 june 2007, she says that: david isaacs was my half-brother.
she refers to a genealogical chart prepared by norman b. tindale as part of his extensive genealogical work throughout australia as supporting her assertion.
the original application was not authorised by that process and, it seems to me, the alternative form of authorisation contended for factually is at odds with the primary contention of the applicant concerning authorisation, namely, that ms connie isaacs as elder had the authority of the native title claim group to make the original application, because that was the decision making process mandated by the traditional laws and customs of the native title claim group.
