it may be readily acknowledged moreover, as the commissioner emphasised, that there is no special rule in relation to the ongoing entitlement of a solicitor to continue the practice of his profession notwithstanding bankruptcy, though the reality of so doing effectively and to maximum advantage, especially in the context of a sole practitioner (as of course in the case of mr milne), is a matter of some practical significance to the requisite extent of the careful consideration accorded by the tribunal's reasons for decision.
that conclusion accommodates in my opinion relevant principles of administrative law which are in line with the authorities.
