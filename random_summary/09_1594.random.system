prima facie, division 87 provides (illustrated with the following example), concessionary treatment of a taxable supply of a right to occupy the whole or any part of commercial residential premises (s 87-15) (the inn or room in the inn) in circumstances where the right to occupy the room is provided to an individual, that is, a natural person (s 195-1) for a continuous period of 28 days or more (s 87-20) and the right to occupy the room is provided in an inn in which at least 70% of the individuals who are provided with a right to occupy rooms in the inn are provided with that right to occupy for continuous periods of 28 days or more.
however, mr mccart's november affidavit is sworn and filed 27 november 2009.
all of these supplies are taxable under the basic rules, but may also receive concessionary treatment under division 87.
