he correctly identified that he was required to be satisfied of the matters set out in s 190c(4)(b).
however, in my view s 66(6)(a) makes it plain that in the normal course a competing registered native title claimant is not entitled to be given the opportunity to be heard when the registrar is considering whether to accept for registration a native title determination application over the same area of land.
they submit that the material available to the registrar did not reveal the basis for, and use of, any traditional decision-making process, although (they contended) the authorisation was said in the application to be a traditional one so as to attract s 251b(a) of the nta because it referred to persons listed as elders who gave permission to bring the claim.
