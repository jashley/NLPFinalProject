mr khatri deposes in these terms: the only potential source of conflict that i am able to identify for this court is in relation to the status of the loan account between the company and the plaintiff.
a question remains as to whether or not, as would ordinarily be the case in respect of the appointment of provisional liquidators, an undertaking as to damages ought be sought.
in short, then, it seems to me that the case is one in which it is appropriate to order the appointment of provisional liquidators to this company so as to ensure that it is subject to lawful control in its affairs pending the hearing and determination of the winding-up application.
