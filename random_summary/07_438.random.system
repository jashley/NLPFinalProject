that decision seems to me to be directly on point and adds further support for what, in any event in this case, appears clearly enough from the statutory provisions, namely that mr sapula has no cause of action arising under s 659 of the workplace relations act 1996 (cth).
however, so far as the proceedings in this court are concerned, it is clear to me that, as a matter of law, the proceedings always lacked an adequate foundation and, objectively speaking at least, there was no basis for them being commenced.
