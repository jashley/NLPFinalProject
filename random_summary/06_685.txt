6 in its reasons, the rrt said: "in his claims [in his initial protection visa application] , although mentioning that he was an ijaw and feared persecution because he was an ijaw, he did not mention that he was a member of the ijaw youth council nor did he mention that he was secretary of that organisation.
" the first respondent posited that, by stating that it might conclude that his 'involvement' in the council is a recent invention, the rrt informed the appellant of the significance of his initial failure to mention his membership in the organisation.
the applicant's post hearing explanation for this was that in his protection visa application form he only set out his claims in a general sense.
