the applicant by notice of motion of 5 may 2009 now seeks further and better particulars of: 1.1 the events and transactions which the respondent alleges would have occurred had the 'scheme' pleaded in paragraph 46 of the respondent's response to the applicant's statement of grounds not been entered into; and 1.2 the essential terms on which it is alleged that those events and transactions would have been implemented, or such other particulars as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.
that would indicate that the applicant is sufficiently informed about the commissioner's case, with sufficient clarity and particularity to meet that case.
the applicant submitted that, without the provision of the requested particulars, the applicant would be required to lead evidence, in respect to each and every possible way in which the float could have been structured; whether it would have done it that way; what commercial or other consequences would have occurred if the transaction had been structured in that way; and the reasons why it did not undertake the float in that way.
