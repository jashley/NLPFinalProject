53 in my view, the fact that the credit insurance in place for the first year of the term, apparently to the satisfaction of the parties at the time of the agreement, has for some reason been withdrawn, or partly withdrawn, at least by one of the insurers does not relieve the respondent from its obligations under the agreement.
art ii cl 1 of the convention also refers to an agreement to submit to arbitration certain differences, and art 7(1) of the model law uses the expression agreement to submit to arbitration certain differences.
