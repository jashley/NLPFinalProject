it is also necessary for me to refer to the cross-claim as a whole even though summary judgment, or an order for striking out is sought only in relation to paragraphs 16-28 inclusive.
49 for the above reasons, i am satisfied that the tpa claims cannot succeed and in those circumstances, it is an appropriate case for summary judgment to be entered in relation to the tpa claims in favour of adelaide brighton cement.
paragraph 25 contains an allegation in the alternative to the allegations pleaded in paragraphs 21-23 and it is that adelaide brighton cement has acquired, and may continue to acquire from mr wong, services within the meaning of the tpa pursuant to the terms of the restraint instrument on the condition that mr wong will not undertake or be involved in any way with the acquisition by mr wong, by himself or through gca, from outside australia of bulk cement that he has imported or would otherwise import into australia and the supply by mr wong by himself or through gca of imported bulk cement to anyone within australia.
