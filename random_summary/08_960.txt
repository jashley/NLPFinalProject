on 30 may 2008, i made orders restraining sfc, pending final determination of the proceedings in this court, from taking further action in the australian industrial relations commission (' airc ') to obtain orders against amou and the second respondents under s 496 of the wr act : sydney ferries corporation v australian maritime officers union [2008] fca 817.
the institution of the proceeding seeking an injunction against aimpe under the wr act was unreasonable (as sfc appears to concede).
the explanation subsequently offered by senior counsel then appearing for sfc was quite consistent (as amou correctly submits) with sfc recognising that there was simply no utility in pursuing its claim for injunctive relief against amou if the court lacked jurisdiction to make similar orders against the second respondents.
