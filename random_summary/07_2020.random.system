even if there were a grant of probate or administration, it would not affect the administration of the estate in bankruptcy for so long as the administration continues until cessation by annulment pursuant to s 252a or s 252b of the act.
a request pursuant to s 29(4) is not limited to the court of a prescribed country.
the net result is that the trustee administers the estate of the deceased in accordance with the act, rather than the probate, succession and trust laws of the various states.
