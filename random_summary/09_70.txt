i have no doubt, having regard to this type of administration, the number of clients, the spread of offices and the investigations necessary to prepare a proper report to creditors, that an extension of the convening period is necessary.
in that sense, the outgoings, by way of wages and the like, have ceased upon the termination of staff.
on 13 january 2009, the administrators issued an advice to creditors regarding their appointment as voluntary administrators and convening the first meeting of creditors.
