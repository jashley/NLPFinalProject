the applicants observed that they had in fact established liability under the bond and as surety, although the applicants properly conceded that arguments (2) and (3) "did not occupy a great deal of the court's time".
i accept that, as the respondents contended, the making of the declarations was not seriously contested and that the focus of the dispute at the first hearing was whether, as the second respondent put it, "the bond was, in effect, a good behaviour bond, forfeitable without proof of loss".
had they done so, they could have argued that the commonwealth was entitled to the amount of the bond but they could also have sought to quantify their loss in the event that the court preferred the respondents' submission on the point to theirs.
