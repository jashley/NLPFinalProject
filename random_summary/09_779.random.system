i am satisfied that asic has discharged the evidentiary onus upon it to establish that the informer or informers, other than mr cummins, provided asic with information voluntarily and on a confidential basis and that the information provided had itself the requisite character of confidence.
asic made a similar submission in relation to the documents numbered 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19, 22, 26, 27, 31 and 32 in a redacted or masked form.
asic still opposes the production and inspection of documents numbered 2, 3, 17, 33 and 34 on the ground that inspection of those documents would or might disclose the identity of an informer or informers to asic who are entitled to protection in respect of their disclosures to asic pursuant to pt 9.4aaa of the act.
