mr nathan was not induced to take out the loan with the respondent that he took out on the basis of a representation made by mr mccredie because no such representation was ever made, by him or by anyone else, for or on behalf of the respondent.
the endeavours made by the respondent to repossess the car and to otherwise pursue legal avenues against mr nathan were all, in my view, entirely reasonable and do not begin to approach what might be said to be harassment within the meaning of s 60 of the act .
7 in considering whether any such representation had been made, his honour also took into account that he accepted mr mccredie as a witness of the truth but considered mr nathan "a very unimpressive witness" who told lies to the respondent about being in the movie business in order to secure the loan that enabled him to purchase the vehicle.
