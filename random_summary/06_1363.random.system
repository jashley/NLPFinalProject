a single judge may hear and determine an application to stay an order of the full court (s 25(2)(d) of the federal court of australia act 1976 (cth)).
i therefore consider it appropriate to approach the question of whether a stay of the orders of the full court should be granted on the basis that the discretion to order a stay should only be exercised if the circumstances justify a departure from the ordinary rule that a successful litigant is entitled to the benefit of a court's judgment pending the determination of any appeal ( federal commissioner of taxation v myer emporium ltd [1986] hca 13 ; (1986) 160 clr 220 per dawson j at 222-223).
apart from the exceptional case in which special leave to appeal to the high court is granted, a final judgment of the full court of this court is conclusive of any issue arising under the extradition act (cf rahme v commonwealth bank of australia [1993] hca 62 ; (1993) 117 alr 618 per deane j at 620).
