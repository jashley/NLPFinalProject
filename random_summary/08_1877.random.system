there may well be circumstances where to do so would jeopardise the investigation: see eg gangemi v australian securities and investments commission [2003] fca 494 ; (2003) 129 fcr 284 at [35] , [38]; see also rochfort at 145 (mason j) (stating that request for the production of privileged information should generally be directed to the employer but "the protection of the employer's interests [in the information] must give way to the public interest in the efficient administration of justice in case of collision between the two").
there must be a specific invocation of privilege --- legal professional privilege --- privilege is personal to the holder of the privilege and the privilege may either be invoked or waived.
the two aspects to consider are: 1. whether, in exercising the power under s 127(4) , by deciding to pass the awb information to the afp, asic failed to consider a relevant matter; and 2. a more basic question of power.
