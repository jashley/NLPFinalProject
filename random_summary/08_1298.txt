additionally, it is said by google that no evidence has been filed by the accc in relation to any complaint by an internet user that google's website led to actual or specific confusion or that he or she had been positively misled.
the costs of this application to amend and file the second further amended statement of claim will be reserved, because i think it is appropriate, given google's opposition to the application, to revisit the question of costs after the matter has been more fully ventilated.
i also see force in the consideration that the accc wishes, through the proposed amendments, to have a comprehensive determination in relation to google's continuing method of operation and activity, and to meet the defence advanced by google pursuant to s 85(3) of the tpa.
