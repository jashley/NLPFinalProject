the respondent has discriminated against me in that it refused to reasonably accommodate carriage of my mobility aids and other essential equipment, including medications and sleep machine, without the payment of excess baggage charges.
on 17 july 2006, the applicant lodged a complaint form with hreoc alleging, inter-alia, that qantas and two of its employees discriminated against him in sydney and in mumbai on the ground of race and disability (an injury to his left knee, arm and a sleep disorder).
conclusion in conclusion, i am of the view that his honour's conclusions on the two matters sought to be raised on appeal are not infected with any error and that even though a refusal of leave may effectively put an end to the applicant's substantive rights, no useful purpose would be served by a grant of leave, nor would the applicant suffer substantial injustice.
