in support of that submission, reliance was placed on what appears from the unreported reasons for judgment of jacobson j in szgzw v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2006] fca 457 , where at [45], his honour observed, in relation to a delay of eight years from 1996 to 2005 in applying for review of an adverse tribunal decision, as follows: it follows from what i have said, that the discretion to refuse relief miscarried within the well known principle stated in house v r [1936] hca 40 ; (1936) 55 clr 499 at 504-505.
outline of the appellants' case presented on the appeal to the federal court, being principally related to contraventions or otherwise by the minister of s 424a --- my observations and responses contextually appearing the material presented in writing by the appellants at the hearing of the appeal from the decision of the federal magistrates court consisted of an amended notice of appeal and written submissions, which were provided by the appellants only several days prior to the hearing of the appeal.
in the course of oral submissions, counsel for the appellants pointed to the tribunal's reliance on information regarding the first appellant's employment history, place of residence and previous arrest warrants, all being information gleaned from the first appellant's application for a protection visa, and which was purportedly used by the tribunal in the formulation of its first set of reasons without the appellants being given prior particulars of that information, as stipulated by s 424a(1).
