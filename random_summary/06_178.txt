the registrar having referred the matter to me pursuant to o 46 r 7a, i do not think that i am deprived of the power given to me by that rule to give a direction to the registrar by the opening of the file and the sealing of the process proffered.
15 in effect, it seems to me kinder to mr bowen so to direct the registrar, rather than to allow him to serve any proceeding on the proposed respondents and, as is certain to occur, to be unsuccessful and to incur further liability for costs.
to the extent to which there may have been available to mr bowen rights of appeal or review under state law, he does not appear to have availed himself of them, although he says he has made some attempt in the recent weeks in the county court to obtain a stay on the sale of the farm.
