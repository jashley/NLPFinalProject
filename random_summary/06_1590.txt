in such a case the rule 17(d) process might remain incomplete and require completion by that medical practitioner or another.
the trustee in my view was correct to conclude that mr gilberg had no entitlement to a tpd benefit because the conditions for such an entitlement stipulated by rule 17 had not been satisfied.
the rules did not entrust to the trustee the task of forming an independent medical opinion.
