the current status of the respondents who are the moving parties on the notice of motion is as follows.
the first respondent, mr john cosgrove, is the secretary of the nuwq and an industrial officer of that organisation; he is a member of both the nuw and nuwq.
the applicant submits that, although the tenth and eleventh respondents are no longer persons bound to perform and observe the rules of the nuw, they should be subject to interim orders because they are the servants and agents of mr cosgrove in his capacity as secretary of the nuwq.
