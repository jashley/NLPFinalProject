i have not placed any weight when making this decision on the unsigned statement purporting to be a statement from the applicant's mother as at the time of making this decision this statement has not been signed by the applicant's mother and cannot be taken to be a true indication of her views or opinions.
nor did the tribunal member assert any absence of genuineness about the reasons advanced in the letter of 5 may 2006.
i do not accept this as a satisfactory explanation for this conflicting and contradictory evidence as the evidence presented over time is not lacking in detail but is directly contradictory.
