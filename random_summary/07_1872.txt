it seems to me that a fair reading of the scag procedures, the coag compendium and the policy paper suggests the confidentiality arrangements between the responsible ministers were put in place to achieve cooperation between all of the governments on a matter of national importance.
8 clause 7 of the agreement provides that decisions made by the ministers in relation to the cooperative legislative scheme for censorship in australia and the consideration by the ministers of matters relating to the administration of the scheme are to be effected through scag in accordance with its procedures.
5 the gist of what is put against the continuation of the orders is: &#8226; the claim for confidentiality in the affidavit evidence is analogous to a claim for public interest immunity for classes of documents which ought to be considered with some scepticism; and &#8226; open justice points in favour of members of the public being able to access the evidence in the case; without the scag material it is not possible to properly understand the evidence, the submissions and the decision which i am about to deliver; and &#8226; the last mentioned public interest is said to be particularly apt because there is a "no evidence" ground of review in which adultshop's submissions invoke the scag material.
