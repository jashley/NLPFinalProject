the liquidator does not seek the removal of the restriction on the use of mr mason's evidence because there is now no proceeding in which the evidence could be used.
i see no reason why the liquidator should be restricted in carrying out any investigation which the statute permits him to carry out now that the supreme court proceeding is at an end.
i went on to say that if during the course of the examination of mr mason the liquidator uncovered evidence that might assist his prosecution of the supreme court action, that was not untoward.
