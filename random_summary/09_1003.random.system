there can be no suggestion, in my opinion, that his honour was wrong to allow the deputy commissioner's counsel to cross-examine mr nicholls in relation to matters which mr nicholls said were relevant to the application for adjournment.
the applicant's application states that the grounds for the application appear in an attached affidavit.
for the reasons which follow, i do not think, in the context of this proceeding and having regard to the history of this proceeding, it is a special reason.
