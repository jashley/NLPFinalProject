for present purposes i am prepared to assume that the email could attract client legal privilege under s 119 of the evidence act 1995 (cth).
12 the terms of the proposed amendment insofar as presently relevant and for that matter the declared purpose sought to be secured by it are as follows: 8.6 ovcharenko represented to dr keung in trade and commerce that the reason for inserting the proposed clause 52.1 (now clause 50.1 of the distribution agreement) into the distribution agreement, was to incorporate a bonus offer in schedule 5 (" the clause 50 representation ").
nonetheless, i am not satisfied that the evidence that has so far been adduced could properly be said to establish that contravention such that relief under s 87 could be claimed.
