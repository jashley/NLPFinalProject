all employees in those locations who were not relieving knew when they were to work.
3 ms mackay's case differs from that of ms bell in the following respects: &#8226; she became a full time employee under the award on 5 november 2001 in a non-relieving position; &#8226; from 5 november 2001 until the date of the filing of the application she worked regular fixed hours, in circumstances where she was fully aware of the days on which she was rostered off work in any given week.
5 for the above reasons and the reasons set out in bell as to the proper construction of cl 26 of the award, the application is dismissed.
