during the audit the australian tax office requested that the taxpayer provide relevant documents, but no documents were produced.
if, during the course of the audit or the objection process, the taxpayer had made the disclosure it subsequently made during the litigation process, it is likely that there would have been no litigation.
that request for an extension was refused.
