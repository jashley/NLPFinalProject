' 14 as i would understand it the united states of america has indicted or wishes to indict the applicant, mr rivera, for the murder of the deceased female.
i should indicate that in this matter there have been no pleadings filed.
the department had been at pains to ensure that mr rivera had every opportunity to present whatever material he wished to the department to ensure that his submissions could be taken into account by the minister in exercising his powers under s 22 of the act one way or another.
