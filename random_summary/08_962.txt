there is no difficulty with any of these conditions, but it is necessary to add to the draft orders that were submitted to me this morning by mr fernon an order that the plaintiffs pay asic's costs of $434, and i will so order.
there can be no suggestion of any want of impartiality, but the failure of the previous liquidators to respond to the letter or to appear before me this morning, i think, impels the adoption of the course proposed by young j.
as i have said, i also order that the plaintiffs pay asic's costs of $434, and direct that the liquidator be directed to notify asic upon conclusion of the winding up.
