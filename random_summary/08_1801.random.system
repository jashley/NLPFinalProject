90 although i note that anz increased its risk assessment rating of damilock both in october 2006 and in january 2007, i do not regard those ratings increases (downgrades), or the further rating increase (downgrade) in february 2007, as direct evidence of solvency.
i am mindful of not forming a judgment of solvency or insolvency with the wisdom of hindsight, so i do not have regard to evidence about creditors' attitudes during january 2007 (except in the case of the agio group, which by the letter of 15 february 2007 was raised by the creditor).
that is reflected in damilock's budget.
