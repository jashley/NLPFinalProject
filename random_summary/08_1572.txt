it received submissions from asic and cemex.
the panel reached the requisite level of satisfaction in this case: (a) as a result of the unacceptable circumstances persons who sold shares between the 10 april and 7 may announcements did so in a market that was not efficient and informed.
therefore the only issue for me to decide on this point is whether the panel was required to have regard to it.
