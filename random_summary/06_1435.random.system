3 the better course is to send the matter to the supreme court with this issue undetermined and let the parties decide what they want to do about it there.
the proper remedy may well be to let a party continue with its claim, but to ensure that all the detriments that the opponent can point to are overcome.
but, in circumstances where, as i am inclined to think, a reasonable expectation has arisen that there was nothing further to come in litigation between the parties, we are in the area of discretion and, i think, possibly unconscientious conduct --- an area where the court carefully moulds its remedies.
