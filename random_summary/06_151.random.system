1 on 21 october 2005 i dealt with one aspect of a motion by aaron stephenson for access to subpoenaed documents for the purpose of use in other proceedings and for related relief.
i certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice gyles.
i should indicate that i propose to order that stephenson should pay the costs of apra, and any other party that appears, on a solicitor client basis.
