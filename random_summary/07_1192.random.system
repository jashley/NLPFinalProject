then the matter can be dealt with appropriately by those representing the appellant as well as those representing the respondent, new south wales police service, or any other person who may take over the conduct of the respondent's case on the appeal.
the parties will then be able to debate, in an informed way, before the court the way in which the appeal ought thereafter to proceed, the appellant's entitlement to bail, and the conditions, if any, which ought to attach to any grant of bail that might be appropriate to give to the appellant.
this undertaking was given in the context of the appellant, and those advising him at that time, understanding that the appeal from the decision of the local court of new south wales sentencing the appellant to a term of six months' weekend detention lay to the district court of new south wales, rather than to this court pursuant to the provisions of the copyright act 1968 (cth).
