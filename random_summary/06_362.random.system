1 this is an application for leave to appeal from the decision of federal magistrate smith given on 24 november 2005, whereby his honour found that the applicant's application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal ('rrt') earlier made to the federal magistrates court constituted an abuse of process.
thereafter my attention was drawn to s 24(1a) of the fc act, which provides that an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment referred to in subsection (1) that is an interlocutory judgment, unless the court or a judge gives leave to appeal.
