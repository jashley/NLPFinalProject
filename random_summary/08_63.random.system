20 order 80, r 4(1) and (2) provide as follows: (1) the court or a judge may, if it is in the interests of the administration of justice, refer a litigant to the registrar for referral to a legal practitioner on the pro bono panel for legal assistance in relation to a proceeding before the court.
a referral has been refused where it has been concluded that proceedings disclose no arguable basis or disclose no reasonable prospects of success: see, eg, ri v era v commonwealth of australia [2007] fca 1465 ; rivera v minister for home affairs [2008] fca 1.
23 no power to make a referral exists prior to the commencement of proceedings, be it at the request of an individual or a corporation, whether or not represented by a solicitor.
