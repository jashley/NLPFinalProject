this is an application under section 447a of the corporations act 2001 (cth) ( act ) for an extension of the period fixed by section 439b(2) for the adjournment of a meeting of the south wagga sports and bowling club ltd (administrator appointed) held pursuant to part 5.3a of the act.
here, the creditors have requested the administrator to grant an extension up to 1 june but for reasons mentioned above, the administrator has taken the view that a slightly longer period may be required.
mr chamberlain informed the creditors that a further extension would involve the necessity for an application to the court, and the creditors resolved that mr chamberlain should make that application for an extension of the adjournment period to 1 june 2009.
