in my opinion mr johnston is advised to avoid all stressful circumstances, or circumstances that may be likely to induce stress, including he must avoid flying of any description for a period of not less than three weeks.
the important aspect of that report for the resolution of this case is that dr adsett made no mention at all of any restriction on mr johnston's ability to fly.
the report stated that dr adsett had prescribed two medications, "sotalol hydrochloride" and "stilnox" tablets to mr johnston.
