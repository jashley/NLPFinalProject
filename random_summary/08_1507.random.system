5 more than five years have passed since the primary judgment of dowsett j from which the applicant seeks to appeal was delivered.
i certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice collier.
while dr chalk has deposed that he has treated the applicant for approximately ten years and that the applicant suffers from chronic mental illness and while i understand that the applicant suffered a breakdown in 2003, this does not adequately explain a delay of more than five years in bringing the present application.
