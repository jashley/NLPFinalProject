2 when the matter came on for hearing before me, mr walsh handed up a draft statement of claim setting out the bases on which he brought the application.
while his honour held in that case that the court had jurisdiction because mr walsh had pleaded the trade practices act 1974 (cth), in the present case, and apparently as a consequence of his honour's earlier decision, the draft statement of claim has been amended to exclude that claim with the result that it fails to incorporate a federal element, and as a consequence this court has no jurisdiction.
