the applicant seeks such an order.
3 i do know from mccormick v riverwood international (australia) pty ltd [2000] fca 32 that for the purposes of an application under o 62, r 36a(1) it is not relevant that the action could have been brought in another more suitable court, because that is covered by a different rule, namely o 62, r 36a(2).
the rule should encourage a plaintiff to negotiate with his solicitor and with counsel on a rate of fees that are appropriate to small claims.
