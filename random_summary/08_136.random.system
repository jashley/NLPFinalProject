beyond that i respectfully see little merit in this case in considering judicial paraphrases of ordinary english.
in short, i am not satisfied that this is one of those rare cases where it is appropriate to have this court intervene by way of declaration in statutory process (see also in another context, kamha v australian prudential regulation authority (2007) 98 ald 49; [2007] fca 1422 at [9] and [13]).
paragraph 20 was added to the statement of claim as follows: "at all relevant times the marks the subject of the australian trade marks applications specified in paragraphs 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14a and 14b were and are not registrable by the respondent as trade marks under the trade marks act .
