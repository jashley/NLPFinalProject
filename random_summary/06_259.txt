one approach suggested by counsel for mr de bruyn, as a mater of practice and procedure, is that the respondent might file and serve an affidavit which identifies foundation facts persuasively demonstrating a need to adduce additional "confidential information" going to additional factors supporting the ground already identified as the basis for the claim of public interest immunity.
