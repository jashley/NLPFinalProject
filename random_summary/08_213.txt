i also have before me an application by the defendant for an adjournment of the application on the footing that over some period of time there has been before the deputy commissioner an application by companies within the consolidated group of companies, of which video and audio (australia) pty ltd is one, for a refund of gst which would, if paid, fall in for the benefit of this defendant.
on 15 january 2008, the deputy commissioner wrote to mr hall on behalf of the defendant and said that: we advise that the deputy commissioner will consent to an adjournment for four weeks until thursday, 21 february 2008, or the next available court date, to allow completion of the current audit investigation and for any resulting refund to be processed.
the interim recommendation apparently is that the application for a refund is to be rejected.
