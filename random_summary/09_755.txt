if a lease is terminated under an order under s 444f it does not reinstate the lease or create a fresh lease.
that is not the case in this proceeding.
moroever, the power conferred by s444f(6) to impose conditions upon the making of an order does not seem appropriate in a case where it is the respondent and not the applicant upon which the conditions might be imposed.
