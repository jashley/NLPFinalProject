it should not be overlooked that r 15(2) enables leave to be given "at any time"; the "special reasons" relevant to such a power cannot but describe an elastic test, suitable for application across a range of situations, from an oversight of a day to a neglect persisted in during a prolonged period.
there is no evidence to suggest that any application for the funding of an appeal was made within that 21-day period, which would perhaps explain inaction within that period.
this assertion does not appear to have been contested.
