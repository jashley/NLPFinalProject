the evidence is that those moneys are due to mrs hudson as part of a settlement on her divorce from mr hudson, by reason of a miscalculation when the amount due was translated from new zealand dollars to australian dollars.
subsequently wilson fm dismissed the remaining matters in mr hudson's application, those orders being made on 17 august 2007.
7 bearing in mind the costs that have been incurred to date, the fact that on no occasion has mr hudson chosen to appear, his apparent failure to respond to any of the letters sent to him by the solicitors for the trustee and the delay that has been occasioned in the administration of the estate to date, it is appropriate to proceed today.
