what is meant is that discovery must not be used for the purpose of ascertaining whether a case exists, as distinct from the purpose of compelling the production of documents where there is already some evidence that a case exists: see, for example, commissioner for railways v small (1938) 38 sr (nsw) 564 at 575; associated dominions assurance society pty ltd v john fairfax &amp; sons pty ltd ; wa pines pty ltd v bannerman ; barbarian motor cycle club inc v koithan (1984) at 486; nestle australia ltd v commissioner of taxation (1986) at 82-83; mobex pty ltd v comptroller-general of customs (unreported, federal court, foster j, 18 may 1994), at p 18.
