it may be that it is unlikely that the police, arresting a person of the applicant's background...would refer to her race, religion or support of a political party but, nevertheless, a reference to those issues by the tribunal does not itself constitute, in my view, an error of law.
... i do not accept the claim that the police subsequently visited her home, or wrote her a letter stating that she should attend the police station again.
no mention was made of her race, religion, or her claimed support for the keadilan party by police.
