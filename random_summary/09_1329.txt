the federal magistrate rejected the appellant's third ground on the basis that, having made two findings, each of which was fatal to the application, the tribunal was not obliged to consider the appellant's finances.
the appellant's failure to satisfy the english language proficiency requirement meant that he could not satisfy at least one essential requirement for a 572 visa.
accordingly, the test taken by the applicant in january 2009 was never capable of satisfying the clause in any event.
