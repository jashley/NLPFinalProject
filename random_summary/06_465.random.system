if a compensation award is made, the court will have before it the evidence necessary to conclude that native title does not exist over the land.
it provides as follows: 'if: (a) the federal court is making a determination of compensation in accordance with division 5; and (b) an approved determination of native title has not previously been made in relation to the whole or part of the area concerned; the federal court must also make a current determination of native title in relation to the whole or the part of the area, that is to say, a determination of native title as at the time at which the determination of compensation is being made.
the heading to s 51 ('criteria for determining compensation') appears to equate 'determining compensation' with 'determining the quantum of compensation'.
