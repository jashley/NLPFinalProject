19 my conclusion, therefore, is that r 11(5) should apply and that, subject to my observations below in relation to other considerations, the defendants are entitled to an order that the plaintiffs pay the defendants' costs in respect of the claim after 9 december 2005, taxed on an indemnity basis.
18 in addition, in my view, it would not have been imprudent, reckless or unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to accept the offer of compromise in this case.
on 23 december 2005, under cover of a "without prejudice" letter, a further notice of offer of compromise in similar terms was sent by the defendants to the solicitors for the plaintiffs.
