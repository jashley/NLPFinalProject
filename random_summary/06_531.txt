she also submits that o 6 r 2(b) does not permit an applicant to seek leave nunc pro tunc and not where a limitations defence is available.
20 ms richards, who appears for mr johnston, contends that o 6 r 2(b) does not contemplate that an applicant may file an amended document and thereby commence proceedings against a further respondent.
ms richards raises a number of other ways in which the fasc fails to comply with the rules, specifically o 13 r 8(1) and failure to mark up the amendments and submits that, while the amended documents have been filed, they were not properly filed as they failed strictly to comply with the requirements of the rules.
