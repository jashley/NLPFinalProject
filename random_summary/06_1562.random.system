the appellants there raised two grounds: first, that the tribunal constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction when considering whether mrs lobo met cl 845.216 --- based, inter alia, on the assertion that various factual matters were not taken into account; second, the appellants alleged that the tribunal had breached s 359a of the act.
on balance of the evidence, the tribunal is not satisfied that the visa applicant "maintained direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business ... from day to day and in making decisions that affected the overall direction and performance of that business" in the 12 months prior to the date of application.
the tribunal had affirmed a decision by a delegate of the respondent minister to refuse to grant the appellants a business visa under the migration act 1958 (cth) ('the act').
