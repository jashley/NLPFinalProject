i am satisfied that an order in those terms would be within the power of the court and would comply with the requirement that an order that makes a determination of native title must set out details of the matters mentioned in s 225 of the native title act .
one of those orders is that the githabul nation aboriginal corporation is to hold the native title rights and interests as agent for the githabul people who are the common law holders (s 56 and s 57(2) and (3)).
13 before adjourning the court i wish to thank all those who have worked so hard to make today such a wonderful occasion.
