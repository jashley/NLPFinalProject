i put to mr wood examples where courts have held, such as in hamilton v whitehead [1988] hca 65 ; (1988) 166 clr 121 at 127, that the act of an individual was the act of the corporation.
23 i do not believe that it is in the interests of justice that i, at this point in a fraud trial where other respondents have yet to give evidence, should be diverting myself from considering the evidence as a whole at the end of the case by considering this submission on the basis as to whether i, as the judge, would find for the fifth respondent.
in such a case he upholds the submission.
