this is because the implied undertaking will bind any person to whom the documents are given ( distillers co (bio-chemicals) ltd v times newspapers ltd [1975] 1 qb 613; sofilas v cable sands (wa) pty ltd (1993) 9 war 196, hamersley iron pty ltd v lovell (1998) 19 war 316) at least once he is aware that the documents have been obtained by way of discovery (p matthews &amp; h malek, disclosure (2 nd ed, 2000) at [13.09]).
