prior to july 2007 they were represented by goldfields land and sea council.
the applicants have not sought to amend their application since consideration by the delegate, nor have they indicated any intention to do so.
the delegate found that the information relevant to authorisation was either uncertain or insufficient; subsection 190b(2) --- the delegate was not satisfied that the information and map provided by the applicants were sufficient for it to be said with reasonable certainty that native title rights and interests are claimed in relation to the areas specified; subsection 190b(5) --- the delegate did not consider that the factual basis on which it was asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed exist was sufficient to support each of the particularised assertions in s 190b(5); subsection 190b(6) --- the delegate did not consider that, prima facie, the applicants had established their connection with the claim area and found that there was an insufficient factual basis for the claimed native title rights and interests; and subsection 190b(7) --- the delegate was not satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group has a previous or current traditional physical connection with any part of the application area.
