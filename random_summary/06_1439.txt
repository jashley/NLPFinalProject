mr leathem has given evidence that in the course of the discussions, mr patel of exact assured him that even if a deal was not reached, esa would only pursue clients who had offices in "multiple countries".
due to the urgency of the matter and the need to reduce the subject matter of the interlocutory dispute in the way discussed with the parties during the hearing, my reasons will not set out the evidence in great detail.
2 the urgency arises because in about late september 2006, after the commencement of these proceedings, hume became aware that esa had invited the applicants' customers to attend a marketing event to take place on 18 october 2006.
