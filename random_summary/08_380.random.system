i am not satisfied that the applicant has had an adequate opportunity to deal with the evidentiary basis for the costs order which is now sought, having been effectively provided with less than one working day's notice of the basis for those costs.
whether fixed or lump sum costs are awarded is in the discretion of the court.
they sought that mr tiata's application for judicial review "be dismissed with costs".
