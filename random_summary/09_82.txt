i should add that in exercising the discretion, i have taken into account the estimate that some five days may be needed for the further hearing of evidence, and i have particularly taken into account the costs that will necessarily be entailed to each party in a further hearing.
one way of describing granitgard's access to mr gabriel is that it is the product of what one might term a whistle blower, an anonymous whistle blower.
mr gabriel's evidence as foreshadowed is not evidence which it could be described as available with the exercise of due diligence to granitgard at any stage prior to the closing of its case or, for that matter, the closing of termicide's case.
