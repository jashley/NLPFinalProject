the third related matter is that, having regard to mr gore's frequent changes of mind in relation to the seaford fee, it would be unrealistic to treat mr boucher, an accountant of long experience, acting in this instance as mr gore's agent, as intending by sending the fax to bind his principal when he knew that mr gore was vacillating as to whether to agree to pay the seaford fee and had not given him explicit instructions to agree to it.
i answer the preliminary question posed at [3] as follows: the document titled furman/gore joint venture: basis of negotiated distribution of bank account , a copy of which is exhibit mf3 to mr furman's affidavit sworn 27 february 2009, did not constitute an agreement between mr furman and mr gore as to the final distribution figures as alleged in paragraph 37 of that affidavit.
in mr furman's final conversation with mr boucher before the fax was sent on 7 august, he claimed mr boucher said $236,000 would be acceptable, and it was agreed that mr saltzman would make the appropriate adjustment at the meeting next morning.
