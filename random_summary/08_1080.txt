16 in my view, the applicant has satisfied the requirements of o 8 r 3(2), and i order that the first respondent be served in relation to these proceedings.
in my view, there is no question that the court has jurisdiction in this proceeding and that the proceeding is of a kind mentioned in o 8 r 2 items 11, 12, 13 and 21.
the court requires only that there be material before the court, from which inferences are open and which, if translated into findings of fact, would support the relief claimed.
