i note first that it purports to provide a clarification of the relationship between stanhope and allmark.
it is allmark's case that that is what hardel holdings is doing and no more.
what, it is said, makes mr riggs' explanation the more questionable is that allmark was not a minority shareholder in hardel holdings.
