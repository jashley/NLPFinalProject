request submits that option 2 fell within the general issue of disconnection charges as disclosed to the parties, because: &#8226; telstra knew that its lss transfer process, which it disclosed to accc, was a consideration relevant to the calculation of disconnection charges; and &#8226; the non-participation of telstra (bigpond) in the lss transfer process was raised in the submissions of the other parties (of which telstra had received copies).
282 telstra submits (ground 5(a)) that by adopting the pooling and allocation method accc failed to take into account a mandatory relevant consideration, namely, "the direct costs of providing access to the declared service" (s 152cr(1)(d) of the act).
the lss is not a core service.
