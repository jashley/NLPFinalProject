i accepted that there was no evidence that siminton proposed to leave australia but stated: 'having regard to the public interest aspect of this litigation, the harm that would be suffered by the public if [siminton] did leave, ..... the difficulty [apra] is having in locating the respondent and, in particular, [siminton's] clear indication that he does not recognise the processes of australian law to be binding upon him, this is an exceptional case that justifies the orders being applied for by [apra].
9 further, there is a serious question about siminton's failure to surrender his passport as ordered.
his honour was in no doubt that there was a serious issue to be tried and that the balance of convenience favoured the grant of the injunctive relief sought.
