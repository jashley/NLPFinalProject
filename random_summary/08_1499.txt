10 a question has been raised before me about whether it was appropriate that dromana be represented in the matter by senior counsel.
alternatively, it is said that a departure from the ordinary practice of the court is warranted because mr gryst persisted in what should on proper consideration have been seen to be a hopeless case: see j-corp pty ltd v australian builders labourers federated union of workers --- wa branch (no 2) (1993) 46 ir 301 at 303.
mr gryst served a statutory demand on dromana which in the event proved to be ineffectual to found a winding up order.
