ms hazleton explained the cah program and took a history from the appellant.
subsection 5(1) of the dd act defines disability discrimination as follows: (1) for the purposes of this act, a person ( discriminator ) discriminates against another person ( aggrieved person ) on the ground of a disability of the aggrieved person if, because of the aggrieved person's disability, the discriminator treats or proposes to treat the aggrieved person less favourably than, in circumstances that are the same or are not materially different, the discriminator treats or would treat a person without the disability.
ms hazelton's evidence was that the appellant had asked not to be admitted as an inpatient but to attend the hospital each day for treatment.
