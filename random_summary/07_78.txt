the tribunal in essence accepted that the applicant was a truthful witness.
in so approaching the matter, the tribunal acted correctly and within jurisdiction and in a manner consistent with the observations of their honours in sjsb v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural affairs [2004] fcafc 255 at [15] , per ryan, jacobson and lander jj; minister for immigration &amp; multicultural affairs v vsaf of 2003 [2005] fcafc 73 at [17] , per black cj, sundberg and bennett jj and minister for immigration &amp; ethnic affairs v wu shan liang [1996] hca 6 ; (1996) 185 clr 259.
the first ground is that the tribunal made a jurisdictional error in failing to properly construe and apply a correct understanding of the notion of 'persecution' and the elements of a 'well-founded fear' of persecution for the purposes of article 1a(2) of the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees ('the convention') as amended by the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees ('the refugees protocol') for the purposes of s 65(1) of the act.
