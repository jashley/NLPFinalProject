mr karp submitted that the tribunal, because it neither considered nor found that there was "informed consent" on the part of the applicant to the withdrawal of the review application, but rather simply observed that the applicant had given general instructions to mr jones to procure a particular outcome by whatever means he thought best, thus committed jurisdictional error.
this ground of appeal must be rejected.
there is no substance in any of these grounds.
