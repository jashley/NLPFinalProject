17 while counsel for the appellant invited the court to allow the appeal for the purpose of allowing the appellant to advance a sur place claim to the tribunal based on his unwise conduct with respect to his passport, he was unable to support the invitation by reference to authority.
5 in relation to the appellant's claim that he had been questioned each time he returned to jordan from iraq, and during the time he was looking for work, the tribunal considered that whilst repeated questioning may amount to serious harassment, the jordanian authorities had a legitimate interest in the appellant's activities because he had spent time in iraq and saudi arabia.
