the present question is whether or not in respect of debts which are due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff, the defendant has, by proper admissible evidence, discharged the onus of rebutting the presumption of insolvency.
the failure to comply with the demand thus arose on 22 february 2008.
mr smallwood contends that the defendant proposes to lodge an objection to the gst assessment arising out of the audit and that having regard to documents which were not made available to, or obtained by, the australian taxation office, the result of an objection, taking account of all of those documents, would be that there would be no additional taxation liability and moreover there would be a refund of $60,000.
