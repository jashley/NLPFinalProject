(2) access to the facility's associated infrastructure, including, but not limited to: (a) railway track, associated track structures, over or under track structures, supports (including supports for equipment or items associated with the use of the railway); (b) bridges; (c) passing loops; (d) train control systems, signalling systems and communications systems; (e) sidings and refuges to park rolling stock; (f) maintenance and protection systems; and (g) roads and other facilities which provide access to the railway line route.
