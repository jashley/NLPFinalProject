as the applicant did not attend the federal magistrates court hearing and his application was dismissed for non-attendance, there are no reasons of the federal magistrate dealing with the merits of his application.
in those circumstances, i exercise my discretion to refuse the application.
as i said to the applicant in the course of his submissions, it is the limited role of the court on an application such as the present to determine whether the decision of the tribunal was made through jurisdictional error.
