having regard to the material i have considered to support the application, the terms of the proposed determination and the submissions of the applicant, i am satisfied that all of the matters in s 225 of the act have been properly addressed.
the proposed determination properly distinguishes between those areas where rights are recognised to the exclusion of all others (schedule 3) and those areas where rights and interests are non-exclusive (schedule 4).
the act encourages the parties to resolve applications through mediation without the necessity for contested adversarial hearings.
