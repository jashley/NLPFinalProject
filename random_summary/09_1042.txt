for the reasons given above i am unable to see how this observation involves an error given the numerous problems that mr field would have to confront in his claim that the trust administrator's appointment was invalid and the consequential lack of prospects of that claim.
in any event, difficulties that might arise in the resolution of a claim are an insufficient reason to prevent mr field from litigating the claim.
the federal magistrates court, at [10], noted that mcdougall j: ...referred to provisions in the guarantee in which mr field waived "all rights of set-off, combination or counterclaim in relation to payment of guaranteed money" , and which denied mr field rights to rely upon various defences.
