even if a full court were to hold that mr siminton had not contravened any of the provisions of the act such a finding would not impinge in anyway on the efficacy of the full court's order that mr siminton pay a $50,000 fine or the legal consequences of his failure to do so.
the full court imposed the fine and provided the mechanism by which mr siminton could be relieved of the obligation to pay it in whole or in part within the 60 days which the court allowed.
i could form no judgment on this point in the absence of a notice of appeal and submissions from counsel.
