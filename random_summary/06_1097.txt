again, that cheque was not cashed by mr hawthorne.
using the base figures referred to above, including real estate valued at $560,000, mr carter says that the net assets of the partnership are about $956,000, after allowing for the liability to the bank, and that the individual assets, that is shares in separate names, are valued at about $43,000.
the hawthornes now say that the sequestration order should not have been made because by 24 april 2006 mr hawthorne had paid $16,403 to the pfeiffers, a little more than the amount of the judgment debt.
