the tribunal cited independent country information as a demonstration of the fact that perpetrators of the violence directed the same towards muslim people, whereas the appellants are hindu, and accordingly their claim that the police would not assist them was not credible, as well as was unsupportable to the extent of its alleged detail.
2 the appellants are a husband and wife and are citizens of india.
the appellants also failed to provide details explaining why they were targeted.
