accordingly and for the purposes of this application, i accept that, as the evidence currently stands, wyeth has a reasonably strong prima facie case for infringement under s 117 of the patents act .
in may 1998 wyeth obtained registration of efexor-xr on the artg.
discussion but for the issue relating to pristiq, i consider that wyeth's position against alphapharm on the balance of convenience is similar to, if not stronger than its position against sigma, which resulted in the grant of an interlocutory injunction in wyeth's favour.
