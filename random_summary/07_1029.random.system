the second respondent, it was said, had no knowledge of the factual basis of the applicant's claims regarding the origin of the disputed trade marks.
however i am not satisfied that the second respondent is likely to or would be justified in incurring the same level of costs as the other respondents.
as i noted at the directions hearing on 22 june 2007, it is not for the parties by agreement to set aside the orders of the court.
