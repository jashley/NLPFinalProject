it has been clear at least since the time of lord hardwicke that information cannot be obtained by discovery from a person who will in due course be compellable to give that information either by oral testimony as a witness or on a subpoena duces tecum.
a person injured in a road accident might know that a bystander had taken the number of the car which ran him down and have no other means of tracing the driver.
here, if the information in the possession of the respondents cannot be made available by discovery now, no action can ever be begun because the appellants do not know who are the wrongdoers who have infringed their patent.
