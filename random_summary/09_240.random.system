the principal question in this application is, in my opinion, the same question identified by the high court in mann v carnell at [1] namely whether the legal professional privilege was lost by a subsequent disclosure of those communications.
ep relies, correctly in my view, upon the provisions of s 118(a) of the act, which provides relevantly as follows: evidence is not to be adduced if, on objection by a client, the court finds that adducing the evidence would result in disclosure of: (a) a confidential communication made between the client and a lawyer; (b) ... (c) ... for the dominant purpose of the lawyer, or one or more of the lawyers, providing legal advice to the client.
there were in fact two e-mails relevant to this matter which were sent on 17 april 2008.
