the learned federal magistrate held that the appellant could only succeed on this ground if he could establish "that there was no evidence at all by which the tribunal could make such a finding.
the tribunal asked itself the wrong question, and thereby made a jurisdictional error, in that it: (a) accepted that the applicant may have been among students who were rounded up in addis ababa in 2001, and again after elections in 2005; (b) accepted that the applicant may he been held in detention, and that he may have suffered inhumane treatment while held by government forces; (c) found that the applicant nevertheless did not have a well founded fear of persecution because he was not "personally targeted by the authorities" and/or "involved at the leader or organiser level" of a political party; (d) thereby erred in failing to recognise that, if there is a real chance that serious harm will result from attendance at political demonstrations in ethiopia, a person who wishes to attend such demonstrations as an expression of his or her political opinion has a well founded fear of persecution even if that person is not "personally targeted" by authorities or involved "at the leader or organiser level" of a political party.
on 23 july 2007 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the then department of immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs.
