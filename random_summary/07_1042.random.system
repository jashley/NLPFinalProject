buchanan j: 1 this judgment deals only with a question of costs.
3 although the respondent's submissions made a formal distinction between the costs of the notice of motion and the costs of the proceedings as a whole in my view it is not necessary to give them separate consideration.
there are no features of the proceedings, or the notice of motion, which require that individual attention be given to each of them.
