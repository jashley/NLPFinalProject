i do not accept that there was a difference in views between mr mckinnon and mr gwynne on the distribution of the pfs work.
the interview was at his office in bourke street.
damon was prepared to take a top sales performer, regardless of behaviours (which he felt he could manage), but agreed to work with his team (richard and grahame) and support them on this decision.
