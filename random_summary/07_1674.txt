background facts 2 mr robertson served with the royal australian navy ('the ran') from 5 january 1965 to 22 march 1988 and had been trained as a diver.
33 since the tribunal found that mr robertson's ptsd had its clinical onset in 1994 namely after his defence service had concluded there could be no scope for any contribution to or aggravation of his ptsd by the subsequent stressors suffered during his defence service as considered in treloar v australian telecommunications commission (1990) 26 fcr 316 unless they were severe stressors which caused the ptsd: see the observations of heerey j in deledio v repatriation commission (1997) 47 ald 261 at 275 with whom the full court agreed (see repatriation commission v deledio (1998) 83 fcr 82 at 95-96).
the commission submits that there was no expert evidence to suggest that the subsequent stressors would have been one of the causes of mr robertson's ptsd and that since there was evidence to show that ptsd arose before mr robertson's defence service, and that the clinical onset of ptsd did not occur until 1994, the tribunal's enquiry into the intervening stressors was irrelevant.
