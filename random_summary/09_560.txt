mr budak replied on 18 september 2007.
an examination of mr budak's reasons of 17 october 2007 for his decision of 18 september 2007 discloses that he considered the substance of the allegations against the parliamentary service commissioner, ms briggs.
one such example is his assertion that the reasons that were sent to him on 17 october 2007 were sent under a covering letter signed by a person other than mr budak and were not therefore "furnished" to him by the person who made the decision as required by s 13(2) of the adjr act.
