the appellant also said that when he had not heard from mr sardar, after the conversation on about 27 april, he believed that the hearing of his case on 29 april had been postponed to a later date to allow mr sardar to prepare and that had he been informed prior to the hearing date that this had not been the case, he would have attended and personally asked for an adjournment, or if refused would have given evidence.
6 the evidence, to my mind, seems remarkably unclear and lacking in any cogency on this point.
the appellant then said that he, after searching the newspaper, found a new agent, a mr sardar and spoke to him on a telephone number he had found in the newspaper on 27 april 2003.
