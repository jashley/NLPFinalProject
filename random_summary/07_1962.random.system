15 if the liquidator's proofs of debt are admissible in the bankrupt estates of the directors, there are subsidiary issues of whether the proofs of debt are admissible only in the joint bankrupt estate, and as to whether the amount of the liquidator's proofs of debt should be reduced having regard to the proofs of debt lodged by the australian taxation office with the trustee, so as not to result in a situation of double proof of the same debt or "double dipping" in the bankrupt estates of the directors.
7 there is an additional issue arising from the fact that the liquidator's proofs of debt are based in part upon liabilities of the company to the australian taxation office.
obviously, there are some differences, but none relevant to the present issue.
