i do not pretend to have understood the full ramifications of that but it makes it desirable, in my opinion, that special liberty be reserved to the applicant to revoke this order once the position in relation to guardianship is resolved.
however, because the applicant is self-represented, it is not easy to necessarily categorise it as only being such a case.
application on that basis is made pursuant to s 12 of the administrative decisions (judicial review) act 1977 (cth) and o 6 of the federal court rules .
