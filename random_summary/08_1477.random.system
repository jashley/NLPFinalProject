in arriving at that conclusion, the tribunal found as follows: (1) mr docherty was mr borg and the payments were made to him [144]; (2) mr docherty had made admissions to ms hird, the commissioner's auditor, that it was he who had cashed the cheques [137], [144]; (3) mr docherty was the last person holding the cash [147]; (4) mr docherty and another brother, charlie docherty, were the shareholders during the relevant years [152]; (5) mr docherty treated 3d as his own entity.
(8) in this regard, the commissioner's submissions (both written and oral) asserted with some particularity the manner in which the price spreadsheets were allegedly manipulated, and these submissions were both taken into account, and adopted by the tribunal, without demur, in finding against 3d.
