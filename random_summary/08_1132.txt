this was rejected by the tribunal and was not relied on by the respondent on the present appeal.
the tribunal's reasoning 11 relevantly for present purposes (ie ignoring the anxiety disorder based hypothesis which is no longer relied on) the tribunal at [65] found that a reasonable hypothesis relating to a causal connexion between mr goodwin's operational service had been raised, namely that a stressor of sufficient severity might have resulted in the worsening of pre-existing alcohol abuse or dependence.
mr goodwin identified the bar theft accusation as most probably occurring in january 1970 but was unable to provide names of witnesses as none of his friends were with him at the time.
