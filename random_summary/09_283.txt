further, the applicant contended that mr phillips was not asked any question about barrett's oesophagus.
in any event, even if i am wrong in my conclusion that mr phillips knew that the fact that he had barrett's oesophagus, was a matter that was relevant to the respondent's decision whether to accept the risk, and if so on what terms, in my view, a reasonable person in the circumstances of mr phillips could be expected to know the matter to be relevant to that decision.
i find that mr phillips did know that he had been diagnosed with barrett's oesophagus, in october 2002 when he applied for life insurance, and, in november 2002, became a party to the contract for life insurance with the respondent.
