he asserted that the questions involved whether the commonwealth had contravened its own consumer laws, the legal services direction 2005, to which i have referred, and whether o 20 r 5(2) and in particular o 20 r 5(1)(b) authorising the court to dismiss an application was a valid order or rule of the federal court of australia.
his honour set out mr croker's explanation, as to why he had not proceeded in the federal magistrates court, which he gave to cowdroy j at the hearing of the application in which his honour found the proceedings to be an abuse of process: see croker [2008] fca 452 at [54] .
