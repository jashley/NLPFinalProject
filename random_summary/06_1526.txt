' 24 in shaw v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs [2003] hca 72 ; (2003) 218 clr 28, callinan j said at [152] - 154]: '152.
34 as i understand the point mr gadd wishes to argue, it is that regulation 4(1) does not operate as a grant of a visa so as to attract the possibility of action by the minister under s 501 of the act.
notwithstanding that the parliament has directed such a result and that proper account must be taken of that fact, nevertheless the deprivation of a person's liberty by an administrative process is such a serious step that i would regard the balance of convenience as favouring the grant of interlocutory injunctive relief in this case in the absence of some countervailing material.
