7 the applicant further submits that, if leave were not granted, and the decision were wrong, the applicant may suffer substantial injustice as a result of my determination of the effect of s 56(8).
13 in the may decision, i found that there was no relevant factual dispute between the parties.
i remain of the opinion that the 'factual dispute' alleged by the applicant is in fact a legal dispute about the effect of facts which are not in dispute, and that the sole purpose of the notice to produce is to elicit further facts on which it can rely and not to resolve any factual disagreement.
