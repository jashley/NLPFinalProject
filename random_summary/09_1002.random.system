the issue before his honour in relation to the application by the deputy commissioner of taxation to inspect documents was whether or not the documents were subject to legal professional privilege.
he said he had obtained information during the currency of those proceedings and the proceedings disposed of by mansfield j on 23 july 2009 and under the freedom of information act , which would allow him to challenge those decisions on other evidential bases.
because that appeal has now been determined, the stay order which was made by mansfield j on 23 july 2009 is no longer in force.
