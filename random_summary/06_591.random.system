27 in the case of mr knight, it is true that his estimates are also stated to be heavily qualified.
7 similar opinions are in evidence from mr rodney knight, a banker who has engaged in efforts to determine whether the earnings statements are false and whether licence fees are payable to the applicants.
the approach submitted by the respondents is, in my view, too narrow in circumstances where the purpose of the preliminary discovery is to evaluate whether proceedings should be commenced.
