by an application filed on 2 march 2007, the respondent, les laboratoires servier ('servier') sought to amend australian patent no 2001276418.
servier points out that the issues as to whether or not the amendments were allowable under s 102 of the act were complex and involved evidence from two experts.
in those circumstances, where half of the hearing time concerned those issues, servier submits that apotex's entitlement should be discounted by 50%.
