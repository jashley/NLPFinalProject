section 482 is in the following terms: '(1) at any time during the winding up of a company, the court may, on application, make an order staying the winding up either indefinitely or for a limited time or terminating the winding up on a day specified in the order.
the reason for this is that, in the ordinary case, there is little practical difference between a creditors' voluntary winding up and a form of winding up imposed by order of the court.
