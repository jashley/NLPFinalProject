phillip mills said that his reference to wagub in the earlier affidavit did not affect the representation of the nagilgaul people at the meeting of 10 august 2009 because those people who attended the meeting and who were descended from wagub are more accurately described as descended from "each of sorogo and wagub".
that imperative remains today.
at para 5, phillip mills said that the meeting acknowledged the attendance of elders from each of the families descended from ancestors sorogo, wagub and neru .
