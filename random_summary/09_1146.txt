section 24(1a) states that appeals from interlocutory judgments cannot be brought unless the court or a judge gives leave to appeal.
at [37] and [38] of the judgment dated 10 july 2009, the federal magistrate stated: the applicant then sought to raise an issue involving the worken matter, which was not listed before the court that day.
at [2] , his honour outlined that he was of the view that the court had no power to grant the application: the court having examined the provisions of the federal magistrates act 1999 (cth) and the federal magistrate court rules 2001 (cth) and having sought from the applicant an indication as to what provisions of the fm act or fmc rules he relies upon in relation to the application for leave to appeal the judgment of 10 july 2009 and receiving no indication that there were any relevant provisions from the applicant and on its own inquiries not being able to find any provisions of the fm act or the fmc rules which give it power to grant leave to appeal an interlocutory judgment, is of the view that it has no power to grant the application by mr ibrahim....this court is not a court of inherent jurisdiction, it is a court of statutory jurisdiction.
