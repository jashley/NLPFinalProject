fugitive: yes.
in tervonen [2007] fca 2067 (at [6]---[9]), i discussed the question as to how a review is to be conducted in relation to s 19(1).
in any event, the point is academic in the sense that the offences which had been added after the last remand (57 and 58) are now excluded because of the decision of the full court as to the s 16 notice.
