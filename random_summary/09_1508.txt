there is also a reference made to observations by the full court in grofam pty ltd v commissioner of taxation of the commonwealth of australia (1997) 97 atc 4656 to the effect that there was much to be said for the commissioner considering settling taxation proceedings in appropriate cases.
the commissioner contended that the evidence was inadmissible because s 53b of the federal court of australia act 1976 (cth) (the federal court act) precluded the admission into evidence of anything said during the course of a mediation conference ordered by the court.
it follows that s 53b of the federal court act applies and anything said during the course of that conference is inadmissible in this proceeding.
