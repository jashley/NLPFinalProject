15 paragraph 11 of the statement of claim alleges that the respondent had reason to believe that the persons to whom it supplied the product would use it affixing or printing at least one image onto one side of the product, which image or images would not be visible from the opposite side to that on which the image was affixed or printed, and that the printed product would then be affixed to a display medium.
it is further pleaded that the use would infringe claims 1 and 8 of the patent, because the use of the product takes all of the integers of both claims 1 and 8.
11 on the face of the statement of claim the pleading made is as follows: "that the applicant is the registered owner of the patent that i have mentioned, with the second applicant being the exclusive licensee" .
