3 the plaintiff contends that on 22 september 2008, without any communication from the liquidator in relation to the claim made by the plaintiff, the liquidator made a final distribution from the funds available to the liquidator which consisted of a significant surplus that was distributed to the members of the company.
moreover, as judge burley said, the other circumstances in which the discretion to defer dissolution may be exercised arise where the interested party needs to make an application in relation to the administration of the liquidation.
also, i have before me a letter from asic which states that asic does not consider it necessary to make submissions in regard to the application.
