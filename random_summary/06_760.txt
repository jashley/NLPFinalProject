' the original application as amended attached a map marked 'lw2' which showed both the lombadina adjourned area and the kooljaman adjourned area as excluded from the claim.
26 there is, in my opinion, no room for debate that the application as originally filed and as it stood after the 1998 amendments did not extend to freehold lands save for that subject to grants to the crown or crown authorities.
it did not show any of the exclusions within the external boundary.
