even if there were special reasons to extend time, the minister noted that the decision in szjtw &amp; anor v minister for immigration &amp; anor [2009] fmca 508 was interlocutory.
further, because the application for review was filed out of time (as explained by the federal magistrate in [4]-[8]) the federal magistrate also concluded that it would not be in the interests of the administration of justice to extend time within which to bring the application for review (at [16], referring to the terms of s 477(2) of the migration act 1958 (cth)).
such a dismissal is interlocutory.
