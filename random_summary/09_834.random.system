moreover from my experience with the native title list in the northern territory, all of the legal practitioners and the parties they represent appear to be willing to progress the matters in the list in a co-operative manner, as quickly and efficiently as possible.
in addition, the applicants and the northern territory have filed a statement of agreed facts, a joint tenure report and joint submissions, in support of the minute.
the nomination is in writing and the corporation has given its consent to the nomination.
