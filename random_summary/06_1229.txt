if the result appears to be unreasonable on the supposition that he addressed himself to the right question, correctly applied the rules of law and took into account all the relevant considerations and no irrelevant considerations, then it may be a proper inference that it is a false supposition.
17 i am of opinion that it was not open to the tribunal, on the basis only of the findings it set out, to find that a person in a single business that consists of running one retail trading shop who makes decisions daily about placing orders and pricing of goods offered for sale, and had done so for over one year prior to his application without any suggestion of supervision or control, did not have direct and continuous involvement in the management of that business from day to day or in making decisions that affect the overall direction and performance of that business.
after reserving judgment and having reflected on the matter, i am satisfied that the tribunal's reasons do not reveal that it misapprehended the tests which it was applying in that regard.
