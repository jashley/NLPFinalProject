' 59 this passage, in my view, comes uncomfortably close to confusing (if not eliminating altogether) the important distinction between a limitation on the scope of a service to be supplied (on the one hand) and terms and conditions relating to the obligation to provide access to the service (on the other).

in the passages which i emphasised, in its discussion of the competing contentions the accc appeared, at times, to confuse the necessity to examine terms and conditions for consistency with a question whether the undertaking was consistent with the special access obligations, although it clearly returned during its discussion and in its final conclusion to examine and make findings about whether the tying clauses specifically were consistent with the standard access obligations.
