the following uses of diesel fuel are not eligible for rebate: (a) the production or manufacture of goods (including rail vehicles); (b) the movement, handling, storage, loading or unloading of goods before or after rail transportation; (c) the transport of passengers before or after rail travel; (d) planning, development or construction of railways, tramways, light rail networks, freight terminals, storage depots or similar facilities or infrastructure; (e) the supply of goods or services (including fuels) to rail transport vehicles by means other than rail; or (f) activities not conducted on railways, tramways or light rail systems.
a person who purchases diesel fuel for use in rail transport is likely to be purchasing in relatively large amounts, even if the rail system in question is very small.
