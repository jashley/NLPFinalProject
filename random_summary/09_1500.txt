their contention is that harry wang was not, as at 24 february 2006, and never has been at any other time, the owner of the anying mark or the trade mark the subject of the registered trade mark; (b) section 60 of the trade marks act .
an ying melbourne was authorised by an ying nz and andrew chen to use the anying mark but only in connection with the business of an ying melbourne, the corporate vehicle in which an ying nz was a shareholder.
i do not propose to strike out or dismiss any part of the cross-claim nor will i order that chuang wang and anying sydney no 1 be removed as parties to that cross-claim.
