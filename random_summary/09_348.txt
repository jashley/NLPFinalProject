section 4(3) defines both "excise tariff" and "excise tariff alteration" as follows: a reference in this act or in any other act to an excise tariff or excise tariff alteration proposed in the parliament shall be read as a reference to an excise tariff or excise tariff alteration proposed by a motion moved in the house of representatives, and an excise tariff or excise tariff alteration proposed by a motion so moved shall be deemed to have been proposed in the parliament at the time at which the motion was moved.
to the contrary, it seems clear that s 114 is a critical part of parliament's recognition of the invariable practice of collecting duties "immediately on the introduction of any change in the tariff, and in anticipation of the measure affecting the change passing into law" ( ex parte wallace at 7).
"officer" is defined in s 4(1) of the excise act as a person employed or engaged under the public service act 1999 (cth) who is exercising powers or performing functions under, pursuant to or in relation to a taxation law (as defined by the taxation administration act 1953 (cth)).
