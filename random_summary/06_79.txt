the reasons for judgment refer to the issues raised by the appellant, and to the evidence (it is clear his affidavits of 11 and 30 march 2005 had been carefully considered).
45 the appellant told the learned magistrate (and explained in his affidavits) that his complaint about service was that he had received the bankruptcy notice and later the petition each in a sealed envelope, so that he argued there was no service in accordance with the bankruptcy regulations 1996 or the federal magistrates court rules respectively.
there was no benefit to the appellant in him doing so, as the cross-examination would have legitimately sought to have the magistrate accept the fact as to the amount of the indebtedness which the magistrate assumed in any event.
