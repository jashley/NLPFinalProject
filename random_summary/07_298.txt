does reg 6.22 impose an obligation upon the trustee to ignore a direction given by a beneficiary to pay an accrued benefit (that is, a benefit in which the beneficiary has an absolute interest) to the beneficiary's authorised agent or to any other person nominated by the beneficiary?
the respondent's contention that the phrase "must not be cashed in favour of a person other than the member" means that a benefit must not be paid to any person other than the beneficiary personally, in effect, amounts to a redrafting of reg 6.22 and not to the proper construction of it.
