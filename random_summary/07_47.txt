mr lang does not dispute this however such a conclusion does not meet his contention that these falls may have been part of the cause of the injury for which liability was accepted.
even if i am wrong, however, my conclusion as to the merits of the present appeal from the tribunal's decision would not be affected because of the tribunal's obligation to give reasons.
