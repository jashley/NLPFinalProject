similarly, in the present case, there was no expectation on the part of the raaf that the respondent consume alcohol at that social function, let alone to the point of intoxication --- such an expectation existed in roncevich .
was the respondent, on account of a raaf-tolerated drinking culture, so affected?
no question arises before me as to that conception in the present case.
