39 mr nicodimou did note the discrepancy between his valuation of the strata units (a total of $54,141,000) and the sales actually achieved (a total of $50,692,000).
in my view, those would be costs associated with the acquisition borne by a hypothetical developer which would need to be accounted for as part of the overall costs of the development and which would impact on his profit margin.
56 however, mr nicodimou accepted that the hypothetical developer would have had to pay the value of the property as at 1 july 2000 in order to acquire it, the property being valued at approximately $23,000,000 and the hypothetical purchaser would have had to pay interest on the basis of a $23,000,000 outgoing.
