(2) it being agreed that: (a) ashmere advanced to fieldmont holdings pty ltd ( fieldmont ) the amount of $100,000, as part of a loan managed by kmf; (b) except for the sum of $27,225, fieldmont did not repay ashmere; and (c) the policy contains an endorsement that excludes indemnity for any 'claim' made against kmf, or any claim by kmf for indemnity under the policy, directly or indirectly arising out of the non-repayment of any loan which was managed by kmf ( endorsement ); having regard to the claims made by ashmere against kmf in the amended substituted statement of claim, does the endorsement exclude any indemnity that might otherwise be available to kmf under the policy in respect of ashmere's claims against kmf.
issues an important preliminary issue raised in these proceedings is whether an insurance policy issued by the sixth and seventh respondents (the insurers) responds to the claims the applicants have made against the fifth respondent (kmf).
therefore, the answer to question 2, whether the endorsement excludes any indemnity that might otherwise be available to kmf under the policy in respect of ashmere's claim against kmf, is "yes".
