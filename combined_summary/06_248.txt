&#8226; by 15 december 2004, only three vehicles remained in burness's possession and the subject of dispute.
1 the applicants in this matter, robert mcdermott, maxwell latimer and ann langdon, were defendants in an earlier proceeding before me.
that proceeding began as an ex-parte application, filed by paul burness as liquidator of richmond sales pty ltd ("richmond sales"), for a warrant under s 530c of the corporations act 2001 (cth).
