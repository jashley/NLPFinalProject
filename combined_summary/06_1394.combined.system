(revised from the transcript) 1 the defendants and mr frederick gulson (who i will refer to jointly just as 'the defendants' in this judgment) move on an application that the court be closed during part of the evidence to be given by mr gulson while he is being cross-examined in relation to mental health issues or any psychiatric condition from which he may, or may have been thought to have, suffered.
40 for these reasons i am of opinion that i should dismiss the motion dated 15 september 2006 filed by the defendants and mr gulson.
