the principal contractor on the site is bovis lend lease pty ltd ("bovis").
a new royal children's hospital is under construction in parkville.
bovis complains that work has been interrupted because elected officials and members of the construction forestry, mining and energy union ("the cfmeu") have impeded access to the site by placing vehicles and other objects on the driveway leading to the entrance gate.
