2 presently, the shareholders of dundee beach p/l are territory realty pty ltd (territory realty), excess pty ltd (excess) and bishop estate pty ltd (bishop estate).
8 bishop estate was registered on 24 july 1995.
i distinguish between the settlement period for bishop estate and excess on the one hand, and territory realty on the other, because i am mindful of the possible availability of some funds to bishop estate and excess by shareholders' loss from dundee beach p/l.
