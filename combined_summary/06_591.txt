1 this is an application under o 15a r 6 of the federal court rules ("the rules") for preliminary discovery in relation to moneys in respect of which the applicants say they may be entitled to recover from the respondents.
the relevant rule provides: ' 6 discovery from prospective respondent where: (a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the court from a person whose description has been ascertained; (b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the court to obtain that relief; and (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision; the court may order that that person shall make discovery to the applicant of any document of the kind described in paragraph (c).
