the respondent, lanepoint enterprises pty ltd, by motion dated 19 march 2009, seeks orders that i disqualify myself from further hearing the matter because i had acted as counsel against mr norman phillip carey, a former director of lanepoint and because one of my brothers-in-law lost an investment in a company related to lanepoint following the collapse, several years ago, of the westpoint group to which each belonged.
mr carey was a witness for lanepoint at the trial of this action.
lanepoint is bound by that election.
