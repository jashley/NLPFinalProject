until 2004, the company had no kilns and no capacity to dry timber other than by air drying.
after comparisons with other kilns, mr carroll and mr cameron planned a timber production budget for 2004-2006.
kiln drying timber involves two drying stages: pre-drying, that is reducing the timber moisture content to a level enabling kiln drying to occur; the drying of timber using the kiln and machining the kiln dried timber.
