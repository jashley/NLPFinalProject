the background to the relief sought is set out in the statement of claim and may be relevantly summarised as follows: on 9 october 2006 the institute issued a media release entitled 'corporate paedophilia --- sexualising children by advertising and marketing' ('the media release') announcing the launch of a discussion paper entitled 'corporate paedophilia --- sexualisation of children in australia' ('the discussion paper'), which the institute caused to be prepared.
the report, entitled corporate paedophilia , by dr emma rush and andrea la nauze, examines advertising and marketing directed at young children and their parents.
only in the annexures are there references, with respect to two photographs, to david jones, in the context of 'possible mild' sexualisation or 'implicit alleged sexualisation'.
