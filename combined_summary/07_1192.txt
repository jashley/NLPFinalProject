1 i was approached urgently tonight in this appeal to grant bail to the appellant pending an opportunity for a hearing on whether or not he should be granted bail or the orders for his weekend detention should be stayed.
the application has been made ex parte in circumstances where, because of the lateness of the hour, i have conducted the hearing by telephone with the solicitor for the appellant being present on the telephone together with the appellant personally.
