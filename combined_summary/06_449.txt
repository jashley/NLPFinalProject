33 the question of whether a breach of s 424b(3)(b) of the act resulted in jurisdictional error was raised in szdql v minister for immigration multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fca 769 (" szdql") .
it seems to me that what sackville j said in szdql as to the object of s 424b(3)(b) applies equally to s 424b(2).
