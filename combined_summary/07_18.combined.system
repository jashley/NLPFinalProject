17 on 17 august 2005 the delegate made an entry in the applicant's file: '17 august 2005 --- reversed cancelled --- uddin v mimia'.
1 this is an application for a declaration that a decision of a delegate of the respondent, the minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs, made on 30 august 2005 cancelling the applicant's student (temporary) (class tu) visa is void and of no effect and for the issue of a writ of certiorari to quash that decision.
on the other hand, if uddin is correctly decided, then the applicant was the holder of a visa as at 30 august 2005 when that visa was cancelled pursuant to s 116 of the migration act .
