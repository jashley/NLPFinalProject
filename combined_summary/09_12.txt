1 in a proceeding issued in this court on 5 august 2008, the applicant seeks a declaration that a summons dated 27 january 2004 and issued to him under s 28 of the australian crime commission act 2002 (cth) ("the act ") is invalid, and a declaration that the examination of him conducted pursuant to the summons was unlawful.
it seems that the summons required the applicant's appearance before an examiner on 17 february 2004, but that the relevant examination was conducted on 19 february 2004.
