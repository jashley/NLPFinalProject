on 18 september 2009, i made the following orders in these proceedings: the appeal is allowed.
for the above reasons, in my judgment, the court has no power pursuant to s 43 of the federal court of australia act to make an order for costs in respect of proceedings incurred in an administrative process which has been the subject of an application for constitutional writs to the federal magistrates court, and then on appeal from the federal magistrates court to the federal court of australia.
