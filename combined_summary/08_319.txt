ex hypothese, the tribunal does not know whether the information is true or not.
1 this appeal from the federal magistrates court ( mzxbq v minister for immigration [2007] fmca 1835 , burchardt fm) raises two questions: (i) whether information which the refugee review tribunal indicates in the course of the hearing, and prior to delivery of its reasons, is relevant to an assessment of the credibility of the appellant's claims, but which is not mentioned in the reasons for affirming the decision under review, comes within the obligations imposed by s 424a of the migration act 1958 (cth); and (ii) whether the learned magistrate erred in finding that the lack of any reference in the tribunal's reasons to the information in question had the effect that s 424a had no application.
