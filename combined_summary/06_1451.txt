1 so far as the categories of documents are concerned in paragraph 1 of the notice of motion which i have been considering, a good deal of my thinking will have been revealed in the course of the debate which has been recorded in the transcript, but i will just run through those documents and indicate a short basis for my rulings.
although i do not equate the recommender with the decision-maker in this case, it seems to me that the specific reference to that material which was before that party brings it within the penumbra which is reasonably producible on discovery.
it is true that the recommender obviously gave thought to these criteria in the course of his mental processes, but what use is made of them, if any, in forming his view is quite unclear.
