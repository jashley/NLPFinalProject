2 the alleged contraventions arose during a dispute over whether hooker cockram projects limited ("hooker cockram") was required to engage an apprentice throughout the construction period of a police and law courts complex in morwell, victoria ("the project").
no apology has been given to hooker cockram.
as there was then no apprentice employed on the site, hooker cockram had broken that agreement.
