the plaintiff (reefton) seeks that the six defendants be restrained from proceeding with a general meeting of shareholders of reefton on 22 january 2007, of which written notice was issued by the defendants and dated 20 december 2006.
reefton seeks the restraint because it has issued a notice of general meeting for 12 february 2007.
