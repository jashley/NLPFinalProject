1 the applicant seeks leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of sundberg j on 30 july 2008: ts production llc v drew pictures pty ltd [2008] fca 1110.
the issue before me is not the substantive question of leave, but whether the application for leave should be heard by a single judge or by the full court.
