in 1995, prismex technologies granted to interium pty ltd ('interium') an exclusive licence to exploit the invention, and interium did so until june 2006, when it went into liquidation.
1 the first applicant, prismex technologies pty ltd ('prismex technologies'), is the owner of australian patent no 647834 ('the patent') for an invention referred to as a display system ('the invention').
the question is important because the liquidator purported to assign all the property of interium, including intellectual property, to the first respondent, keller industries pty ltd ('keller'), which was in competition with interium, and which is still in competition with interests which were associated with interium and which remain associated with prismex technologies.
