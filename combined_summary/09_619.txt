introduction mr sam cassaniti and mr david cassaniti are cousins.
david is a tax agent and his business as such is conducted through a company called armstrong scalisi pty ltd which trades under the name cap accounting ("cap").
sam's contention that that notice has the capacity to undermine the integrity of his proceedings should be rejected.
