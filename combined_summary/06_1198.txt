in response it was said that a certificate from the nqlc was attached.
on 10 february 2006 a delegate of the national native title registrar ('the registrar') made a decision not to accept for registration, pursuant to s 190a of the native title act 1993 (cth) ('the nta'), an application for native title determination on the part of the wakaman people # 2.
i do not understand the submission to be directed to the act of certification by the nqlc.
