introduction 1 mr fenner has fought long and hard to establish his entitlement to a disability pension under the veterans' entitlement act 1986 (cth) (the act) in respect of claims for post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) and for alcohol abuse.
between april 1967 and june 1968, mr fenner made seven trips to south vietnam as a stoker on hmas sydney.
for that reason, i set aside the decision of the aat and remit the application to the aat for reconsideration, limited to mr fenner's claim in respect of his condition of alcohol abuse.
