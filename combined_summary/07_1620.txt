the defendants are mining projects group limited (mpg), a minerals exploration company, and two of its directors, mr frost and mr revelins.
asic contends that in breach of s 1041h mpg made misleading public announcements about the mineralisation and exploration potential for uranium mining at niue island in the south pacific.
the only relief sought against mpg is a declaration that it contravened s 1041h.
