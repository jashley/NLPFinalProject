the applicant, mr stoyef, brings the application as a representative party.
mr stoyef relies only on s 1012a.
50 if necessary, i will hear argument on costs, but my present view is that since mr stoyef succeeded on the main issue that was debated, but masu succeeded on some minor issues, masu should be ordered to pay 60% of mr stoyef's costs of the two motions.
