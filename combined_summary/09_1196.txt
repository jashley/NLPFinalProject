in the substantive proceedings before the court the applicant alleges that the respondent has contravened s 16(1) of the occupational health &amp; safety act 1991 (cth) ("the act").
in permitting this material to be admitted: in my view the appropriate orders are as follows: the court will receive material from mr paul everett, mrs ann everett and mr andrew mccallum, being immediate family members of mr mark mccallum, which material will be confined to the impact of the demise of mr mark mccallum on their lives.
