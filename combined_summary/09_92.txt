this is an appeal from a decision of a federal magistrate who affirmed a decision of the migration review tribunal (the tribunal) to refuse to grant spouse visas to the appellant on finding that, at the relevant times, the visa applicant (the appellant) and his wife (the sponsor) did not have a mutual commitment to a shared life as husband and wife to the exclusion of all others, and that the relationship was not genuine but was contrived for migration purposes.
the fact of the ivf program and the effort and expense involved is not diminished simply by an assertion that some people want to have children together outside of marriage.
