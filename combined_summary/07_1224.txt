1 this is an appeal from a decision of a federal magistrate dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal which in turn refused an application for a protection (class xa) visa.
his honour stated at [29]: "i am inclined to read the tribunal's reference to 'i do not accept that the applicant was a member, a supporter or even had a passing interest in any of the marxist parties operating in kerala at the time the applicant was at school' , in combination with the tribunal's reference to the applicant's lack of knowledge of the marxist or communist party in kerala, as an oblique rejection of the applicant's original suggestion that he had been attracted by marxist ideology [which was made in his visa statement].
