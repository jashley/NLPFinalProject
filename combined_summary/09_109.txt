the appellant (icm) appeals from a judgment of the federal magistrates court of australia given on 25 july 2008 ( young v icm agriculture pty ltd [2008] fmca 1038) by which that court ordered that bankruptcy notice nn68 of 2007 issued on 19 november 2007 and addressed to the respondent (mr young) (bankruptcy notice) be set aside.
the bankruptcy notice was issued by the official receiver on the application of icm and was founded on a final judgment obtained by icm against mr young in the district court of new south wales.
mr young's claim against icm arose out of a deed of assignment of a claim asserted by another company against icm.
