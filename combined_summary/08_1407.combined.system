mr beddoe recalls receiving the email from mr coney.
since mr coney and mr ammit concluded the sale and purchase agreement on 7 december 2007 with effect being given to the agreement by the deed of assignment and the transfer of the shares in cogl immediately on 7 december 2007 and registration of tog's interest in the register of members some time after 5.37pm on the evening of 7 december 2007, it would have been plain to both mr ammit and mr coney that none of the defaulting members had been given notice of an intention to sell the members' interest to tog.
