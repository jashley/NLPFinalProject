the bankruptcy to which the application refers arises from a sequestration order made against mr tsekouras' estate on 14 june 2000 by an order of hely j on the application of mr tsekouras' former solicitor, ms evangelinidis ('the sequestration order').
the first order sought by mr tsekouras in his application filed on 8 december 2008 is: ' the applicant seeks a third party claim as this bankruptcy should never have been instigated by peter olsen on behalf of the insolvency and trustee service australia '.
the application then contains a number of assertions and, in particular, an assertion that ' at the time of the proceedings ' mr tsekouras had paid the sum of $247,705.24 and that in november 1999 he paid further monies in an amount of $166,469.54.
