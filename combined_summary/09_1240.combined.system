in october 1997 mr and mrs boensch separated.
it remains to be noted, although for the reasons given above it does not matter, that the proposed amended points of claim did not include any allegation that, at the time of the transfer of the equitable interest in the rydalmere property, mr boensch was 'about to become' insolvent within the meaning of s 121(2) of the bankruptcy act .
it seems to me that, viewed in the context of mr pascoe's belief that at a final hearing he would be able to provide evidence to support a relevant finding referrable to mr boensch's insolvency, it was open to the learned federal magistrate to highlight what he perceived to be the weakness of the relevant evidence and to express the belief that the applicant had no reasonable prospects of succeeding in establishing mr boensch's insolvency at the time that he entered into the declaration of trust.
