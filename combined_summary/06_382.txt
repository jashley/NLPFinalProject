1 the present application filed on 1 december 2005 is for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal from the judgment of smith fm delivered on 8 november 2005, whereby his honour found that the decision of the refugee review tribunal handed down on 17 june 2005 adversely to the present applicant was not affected by jurisdictional error.
2 the background to that application is that the applicant had arrived in australia as a visitor from china in november 2004, and had been taken into detention some weeks after her arrival for what were considered to be breaches of her visa.
