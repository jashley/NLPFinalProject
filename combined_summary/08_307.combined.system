1 on 19 december 2007, i ordered that this proceeding be dismissed and that the plaintiffs pay the costs of the second defendant ( holcomm marine ) of the proceeding.
subsequently, written submissions were made, although not in accordance with the direction that i gave on 19 december 2007.
i propose to rescind the orders that i made on 19 december 2007 and make fresh orders disposing of the proceeding insofar as it still remains outstanding.
