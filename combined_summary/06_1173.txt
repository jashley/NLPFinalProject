introduction the torres strait regional seas claim is a native title determination application which was filed in the brisbane registry of the federal court on 23 november 2001 in the name of four persons representing communities of islanders in the torres strait.
according to this myth the gizra (dangaloub and gizra), the siepam (torres strait islanders) and the abarsen (malig and gudang aborigines) were all created together.
