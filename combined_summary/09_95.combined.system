this is an appeal against an order of the federal magistrates court dismissing the appellant's application for judicial review in connection with refusal of a protection (class xa) visa under s 65 of the migration act 1958 (cth) ( szmfj v minister for immigration and anor [2008] fmca 1155).
under s 36(2) of the act the criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is (relevantly) a non-citizen in australia to whom the minister is satisfied australia has protection obligations under the refugees convention as amended by the refugees protocol (meaning, in accordance with s 5(1) , the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees).
