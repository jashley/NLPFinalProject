citalopram is a chiral molecule, a racemic mixture (or racemate) comprising in equal measure two enantiomers.
the patent discloses processes for obtaining escitalopram, and data showing that (+)-citalopram is therapeutically more active than citalopram itself, and more than 100 fold more active than (-)-citalopram.
thus, lundbeck denies that cipramil "contains" (+)-citalopram.
