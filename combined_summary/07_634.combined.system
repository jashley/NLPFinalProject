2 two decisions made by the respondent pursuant to the aboriginal and torres strait islander heritage protection act 1984 (cth) ('the act') are sought to be reviewed, namely: (a) a decision made on 21 april 2006 to suspend each applicant's appointment as an inspector ('the suspension decision'); and (b) a decision made on 23 june 2006 to remove each applicant as an inspector ('the removal decision').
as they raise similar principles of law based upon sufficiently common facts, it is convenient to deal with both applications in these reasons, although i will make separate orders in each proceeding.
introduction 1 these two proceedings were heard together.
