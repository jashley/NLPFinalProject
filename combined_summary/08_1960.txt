1 these proceedings involve an appeal against a decision of the federal magistrates court that the appellants pay damages of $26,000 for breach of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) and costs, as well as associated orders for delivery up of items associated with the sale of a t-shirt known as the yellow 33 south t-shirt.
2 the principal claims in the amended notice of appeal filed 26 september 2008 are that the primary judge erred in finding that: - (i) the use of terry fitzgerald's name and image on the yellow 33 south t-shirt conveyed a representation that there was an association between terry fitzgerald and the production and offering of the t-shirt, and (ii) a reasonable consumer in the relevant class would assume that mr fitzgerald had sanctioned, permitted or allowed the production and sale of the impugned t-shirt.
