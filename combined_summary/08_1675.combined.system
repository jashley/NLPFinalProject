introduction 1 section 190f(6) of the native title act 1993 (cth) (the nta), introduced in the amendments made to the nta in july 2007, confers upon the court a discretionary power to dismiss an application, either on the application of a party or on its own motion, if: (a) the court is satisfied that the application has not been amended since consideration by the native title registrar (the registrar) and is not likely to be amended in a way that would lead to a different outcome once considered by the registrar, and (b) in the opinion of the court, there is no other reason why the application in issue should not be dismissed.
