on 2 august 2007, mr chesters sought an answer to the request.
mr chesters was told that the liquidator could apply for a lesser amount.
this application is a little unusual as it is made by the liquidator under s 564 of the corporations act 2001 (cth) (the " corporations act ") in conformity with an obligation assumed by the liquidator under cl 9 of an indemnity agreement made with a funding creditor, the deputy commissioner of taxation ("deputy commissioner") on 6 february 2007, notwithstanding that the liquidator contends that property recovered by him in the course of the winding up as a result of securing a deed of settlement of all claims made by him against particular parties, should be applied in satisfaction of the costs and expenses of recovering the property without first applying any of the settlement monies in repayment of monies paid under the deed of indemnity by the funding creditor even though the indemnity enabled particular recovery steps specified in the agreement to be undertaken.
