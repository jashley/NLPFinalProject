i have an application before me to vary an order made by me on 6 march 2009 in proceeding qud63 of 2009, commenced by john holland proprietary limited against a number of respondent parties, the first of which i will simply describe by the acronym cfmeu, and others.
the order made on that occasion was an order in these terms: (1) until further order, the first, second and third respondents be restrained, whether by themselves, their servants or agents, from entering the abbot point site under section s760 of the workplace relations act 1996 (commonwealth) for the purpose of holding discussions with the applicant's employees.
