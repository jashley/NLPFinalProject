introduction 1 on 20 december 2007 i made orders pursuant to s 21(2)(b)(i) of the extradition act 1988 (cth) (the act) on the application of jan tervonen quashing an order of the second respondent made on 6 june 2007 that tervonen was eligible for surrender to the first respondent, the republic of finland, for certain offences, and the consequent issue of a warrant pursuant to s 19(9) of the act ( tervonen v finland [2007] fca 2067).
that decision was based upon the judgment of rares j in tervonen v minister for justice and customs [2007] fca 1684 ; (2007) 98 ald 589 and consequent orders declaring invalid and quashing successive notices purporting to have been given pursuant to s 16 of the act ( tervonen v minister for justice and customs (no 3) [2007] fca 1898).
that basis for the decision meant that i did not need to consider the other arguments raised on behalf of tervonen.
