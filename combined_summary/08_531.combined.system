introduction 1 this is an appeal from a decision of the administrative appeals tribunal ('the tribunal') affirming a decision of a delegate of the respondent ('the commission') that the applicant's chondromalacia patellae ('cp') of both knees was not related to his service in the australian army.
this symptom forms part of the clinical diagnosis of chondromalacia patellae.
these grounds were: '(i) the tribunal erred in law by: (a) proceeding on the basis that an hypothesis could only be upheld by factor 5(a) of the sop [statement of principles] where there had been a contemporaneous diagnosis of chondromalacia patellae within six months of direct trauma to the affected knee; and (b) failing to consider whether the material before the tribunal pointed to the existence of features, signs and symptoms of chondromalacia patellae within that time such that a clinician could now make a retrospective diagnosis of chondromalacia patellae.
