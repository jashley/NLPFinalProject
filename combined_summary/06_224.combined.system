the trial judge upheld a motion by the first respondent ('the minister') summarily to dismiss the application before that court on the basis of rule 13.10(a)-(c) of the federal magistrates court rules, namely, that there was no reasonable cause of action disclosed in relation to the proceeding; the proceeding was frivolous or vexatious; and the proceeding was an abuse of the process of the court.
