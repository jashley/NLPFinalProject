objection was taken to particular paragraphs identified in the course of submissions on behalf of the wide bay conservation council inc (conservation council) to paragraphs of dr mallen-cooper's affidavit on two bases: that he had not participated in a conference of experts, for which provision was made in pre-trial orders; and an alleged non-compliance with the court's then prevailing practice direction in respect of guidelines for expert witnesses in proceedings in this court, being that given by the chief justice on 5 may 2008.
of substance, though, is that dr mallen-cooper's statement was provided in early august, well prior to the time when dr kind and mr tait came to confer in accordance with the pre-trail direction.
