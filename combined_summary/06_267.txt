the taxpayer applicants are respectively identified in these reasons as 'ief' (for iel finance limited), 'qth' (for queensland trading &amp; holding company limited) and 'spassked' (for spassked pty limited).
from that time, gih was spassked's creditor in place of ief, but, unlike ief, was not charging spassked interest.
i have referred to qth, ief and spassked in these reasons together as 'taxpayer applicants' to avoid confusion, given that the commissioner is the applicant in the present interlocutory proceedings for summary judgment.
