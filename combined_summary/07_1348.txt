the issue raised is whether all or part of the notice to produce travels beyond the documents contemplated by o 15a r 6 of the federal court rules 1979 (cth), and seeks to obtain and test the substance of documents which are appropriate for discovery only in post-action discovery when pleadings have been made and issues are more clearly defined.
