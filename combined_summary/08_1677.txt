2 pursuant to s 190f(5), the new dismissal power applies where: (a) the registrar does not accept the claim for registration because: (i) it does not satisfy all the merit conditions of the registration test; or (ii) it was so procedurally defective as to render it impossible to determine whether the claim satisfies the merit conditions; and (b) the court is satisfied that the avenues for reconsideration and review have been exhausted without registration of the claim.
