1 i have before me an appeal from the judgment of scarlett fm given on 27 november 2006 by which his honour dismissed an application for review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal made on 12 april 2005 and published on 5 may 2005 affirming a decision of the delegate of the first respondent refusing the appellant the grant of a protection visa.
they said that mr zafar persuaded them to lodge a protection visa application for the applicant merely to buy time for him in australia.
they said that their attempts to contact mr zafar, their authorised recipient, in connection with the applicant's application had been unsuccessful in spite of mr zafar providing them with four mobile telephone numbers.
