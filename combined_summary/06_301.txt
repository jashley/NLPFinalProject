1 this is a matter in which the registrar made an order on 16 december 2005 winding up british finance pty ltd (abn 52 096 757 836) (the company).
it is clear from the evidence that the order should not have been made because the evidence for the plaintiff was deficient as it did not take into account events concerning the payment of outstanding liabilities.
