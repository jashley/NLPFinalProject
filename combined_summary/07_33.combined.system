before the tribunal the appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution because of his activism with the trinamool congress party ('tmc') and its arm known as the 'youth congress of the trinamool dum dum committee'.
moreover the tribunal did accept further evidence from the appellant's migration agent submitted after the hearing, being the letter from the dum dum trinamool yuba congress.
the tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs made on 19 august 2003 to refuse the grant of a protection visa to the appellant.
