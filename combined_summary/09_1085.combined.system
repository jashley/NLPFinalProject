presently before the court is what hitherto would have been regarded as a routine application, one which could be easily addressed and resolved.
it is an application to vacate by consent the hearing of an outstanding aspect of a proceeding which has previously been heard in part ( motor trades association of australia superannuation fund pty ltd v rickus [2007] fca 1878 ; motor trades association superannuation fund pty ltd v rickus [2007] fca 2117 and motor trades association of australia superannuation fund pty ltd v rickus (no 3) [2008] fca 1986 , 69 acsr 264) and to fix an alternative date to hopefully suit the convenience of all counsel.
