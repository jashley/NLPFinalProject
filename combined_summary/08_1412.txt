1 these reasons concern the issue of costs following my judgment on the merits in this matter: in the matter of arc energy limited [2008] fca 1396 ("arc energy").
i heard oral submissions as to costs after judgment was delivered but gave arc energy ltd ("arc") and buru energy ltd leave to put in further written submissions directed to the case of re crusader limited (1996) 1 qd r 117 cited by oil basins.
this reflected oil basin's legitimate interest.
