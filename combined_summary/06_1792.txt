1 this is an application under s 473 of the corporations act 2001 (cth) for orders to deal with an impending vacancy in the office of liquidator of a company, militto's transport pty limited (in liquidation), occasioned by the resignation of the first plaintiff which is to take effect on 20 december next, and for the replacement of him by the second plaintiff.
that course of action is rendered necessary, or at least desirable, by reason of orders which have the effect of suspending the entitlement of the first plaintiff to act as liquidator.
