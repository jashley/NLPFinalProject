(revised from the transcript) 1 for reasons expressed earlier today i set aside the orders which i made on 1 march 2006 because the applicant had given the court an explanation for his non attendance and i considered it in the interests of justice that he be allowed to be heard.
i pointed out to the applicant that his present proceedings involved an application for leave to appeal from the federal magistrates court's dismissal of his attempt to review the decision of the delegate of the first respondent for the reasons that i set out in [12], [13] and [14] of my judgment szggs v the minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2006] fca 224.
