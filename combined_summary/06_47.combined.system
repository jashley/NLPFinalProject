1 this is an application to set aside orders made by me on 27 july 2005 dismissing the appeal brought by the applicant.
in any event, having regard to the history of the matter and the non-appearance of mr khan on several occasions, including today, and for the reasons given by mr markus, the appropriate order is to dismiss the application with costs.
i doubt that is so and i am prepared to assume that the court does have the power.
