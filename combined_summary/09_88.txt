wtt carries on business providing taxi-cab network services.
the australian competition and consumer commission (accc) alleges that the second to fifth respondents, three of whom are directors of the first respondent, white top taxis limited (wtt), contravened s 45(2) of the competition code of victoria (code) (as applied by the competition policy reform (victoria) act 1995 (vic)) and that wtt, contrary to s 45(2)(b)(i) , was involved in those contraventions.
hence each owner of each shepparton taxi-cab became a member of wtt.
