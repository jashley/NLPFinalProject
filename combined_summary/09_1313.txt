mr heyward complains that the tribunal admitted into evidence affidavits tendered by the minister that ought not have been admitted.
the question in this proceeding is whether the second respondent, the administrative appeals tribunal ( the tribunal ), failed to provide the applicant, mr julian heyward, with procedural fairness in the manner in which it dealt with mr heyward's application for review of a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the minister for immigration and citizenship ( the minister ), to cancel mr heyward's visa issued under the migration act 1958 (cth) ( the act ).
mr heyward is a citizen of the united states of america.
