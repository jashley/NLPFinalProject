1 i have before me a notice of motion by which the applicant jacob de bruyn seeks an order that the respondent, minister for justice and customs of the commonwealth, produce for inspection documents referred to in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the affidavit of sally ann nelson filed on behalf of the respondent in proceedings by which jacob de bruyn seeks the issue of the constitutional writ of mandamus on the ground that the respondent has either refused or constructively refused to perform an obligation to determine whether the applicant is to be surrendered in relation to a qualifying extradition offence or offences pursuant to s.22(2) of the extradition act 1988 (cth) ("the act ") within the temporal limitations required by the section, namely, 'as soon as is reasonably practicable having regard to the circumstances, after a person becomes an eligible person' .
as to the claim of public interest immunity, the applicant says this: (a) the position adopted by ms blackburn has no application in relation to those documents passing between the attorney-general's department and the ahc nor any application to documents from the ahc to the attorney-general's department which do not reveal the content of communications with south african authorities.
