1 on 3 july 2008 i published my reasons for making a declaration that the respondent, mr feehan, contravened s 285e(1) of the workplace relations act 1996 (cth) (the act) and i adjourned the proceeding to enable the parties to be heard as to penalty.
he accepted that on my findings the conduct was deliberately provocative which had been engendered by an element of contest and bravado.
