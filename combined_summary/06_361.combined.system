associate: dated: 4 april 2006 prosecutrix appeared in person.
1 i have to decide whether the federal magistrates court had authority (to use a neutral term) to dismiss the prosecutrix' action against the university of melbourne and then to order that she pay the university's costs, as it turns out, on an indemnity basis.
in the action the prosecutrix made several allegations, two of which encapsulate the nature of her complaint.
