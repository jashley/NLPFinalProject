saul disagreed.
the pleadings applicants' claim 1 the first applicant (harold) is the father of the second applicant (saul) and the second respondent (lionel).
jlcs does not significantly feature in the case, and where i refer to harold, saul, lionel and joel as a group, i will call them 'the parties'.
