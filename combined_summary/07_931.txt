the only questions which the court is required to determine in each of the appeals are whether the applicant was, at the relevant time, (a) a "charitable institution" within the meaning of s 65j(1)(b) of the fbta act ; or (b) a "non-profit association, ... established for community service purposes" within the meaning of s 65j(1)(j) of the fbta act .
each appeal is against an assessment under the fringe benefits tax assessment act 1986 (cth) ("the fbta act "), the three years in question being those ended 31 march 2001, 2002 and 2003.
if the answer to either of these questions is yes, the applicant will be a "rebatable employer" for the year in question.
