before me is a notice of motion filed by mr hunter, who is the respondent to a notice of appeal filed by mr conde against a decision of the federal magistrates court.
mr hunter now seeks an order striking out mr conde's appeal on the basis that the appeal constitutes an abuse of process.
no submissions were made by mr macklin on mr hunter's behalf in relation to this order --- indeed mr macklin stated during the hearing that a creditor's petition had in fact been filed (ts p 10 l 45-46).
