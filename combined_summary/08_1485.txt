introduction 1 the mitra 2139 ('the mitra') is a foreign fishing boat which is registered in taiwan.
2 the owners of the mitra say that the 'mistake of fact' defence is available to them because the master of the mitra plotted his position using the geographical positioning system ('gps') onboard the mitra and he believed he was 11 nautical miles outside the afz.
in the early morning of 30 march 2008, the mitra was boarded by personnel from a royal australian navy patrol boat about 7 nautical miles inside the australian fishing zone ('afz').
