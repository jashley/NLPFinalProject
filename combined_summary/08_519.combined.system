the tribunal's decision 8 the tribunal accepted that the appellant was catholic.
his application was based on a number of claimed reasons to fear persecution by the chinese authorities, however the only one presently relevant is his catholic faith.
the appellant's fear of persecution due to his faith was, as finally formulated, based principally on the following matters: &#8226; he was born into a catholic family; &#8226; the church he attended was closed when he was 9 years old; &#8226; the catholic community was forced to attend "house churches", mostly at his house, where a bishop, assisted by a priest, conducted services; &#8226; that priest was often interrogated; &#8226; the police raided his house in june 2003 and confiscated bibles left behind by the fleeing faithful; &#8226; on 9 april 2004 the police interrupted a conference of catholic priests at his house.
