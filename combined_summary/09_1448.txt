when judgment on the substantive claims was delivered ( bhpb freight pty ltd v cosco oceania chartering pty ltd (no 3) [2009] fca 1087) several issues were left for later consideration.
those issues are: (1) on what claim will bhpb elect to take judgment; (2) in what currency should judgment be given; (3) interest; and (4) costs.
it is reasonable that the risk lie with bhpb.
