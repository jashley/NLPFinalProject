it appears that at one stage mr milne's estranged wife lynette milne was an additional applicant in the tribunal proceedings, but subsequently she ceased to be so, at least by the time for the provision of written submissions to the tribunal.
2 the grounds of the commissioner's appeal to the federal court were in the following terms: (i) the tribunal erred in law and applied the wrong test in holding that mr milne would suffer 'serious hardship' within the meaning of subsection 340-5(3) of schedule 1 to the administration act if he was not released from that part of his tax debt which was eligible for release; (ii) the tribunal erred in law by failing to take relevant considerations into account in the exercise of its power, namely: (a) that mr milne had an excess of assets over liabilities; (b) that upon the sale of mr milne's assets, he would have sufficient funds to discharge all of his debts including that part of his tax debt which was eligible for release; (c) that upon the sale of mr milne's assets, his likely income would exceed his liabilities; (d) that mr milne's assets included the sum of approximately $48,000 in cash; (e) that absent the sale of mr milne's assets, he would likely be made bankrupt and other creditors paid in preference to the applicant; (f) that the tribunal had power to order a partial release of that part of mr milne's tax debt which was eligible for release; (g) that at the end of mr milne's working life (ie approximately three years hence), he would be required to sell his assets to discharge his liabilities in any event; (h) that mr milne's expenditure exceeded his income solely by reason of the fact that he was continuing to service loans secured against his unsold assets.
context to the present application by way of appeal from the tribunal 1 this is an application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the small taxation claims tribunal, a division of the administrative appeals tribunal ('the tribunal') which was constituted by senior member robin hunt, being a decision made on 4 july 2005 whereby the tribunal set aside the objection decision of the commissioner and remitted those tribunal proceedings to the commissioner with the direction that the discretion of the commissioner be exercised by way of the grant of appropriate relief in favour of the respondent ('mr milne') under section 340- 5 of the taxation administration act 1953 (cth) ('the administration act').
