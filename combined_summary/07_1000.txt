1 on 24 january 2006 the tug "tom tough" was assisting the vessel "global peace" to berth in gladstone harbour.
the plaintiff in each of these actions alleges that in so doing, the tug came into contact with the hull of the global peace causing damage which led to the discharge of oil into harbour waters.
on 18 april 2007, after i had received submissions in connection with the motion with which i am presently concerned, adsteam harbour pty ltd, the owner of the tug, was joined as second defendant in each action.
