on the one hand, gni, when trading as gni finance corporation, was said to carry on a business of finance origination.
equally though, as the process elongated it was a matter for the appellant as to whether or not gni continued to operate the two nominated "main businesses".
hence, so the submission went, as gni finance corporation was nothing more than a name under which gni carried on business, rather than the name of a separate legal entity, there was but one business which could be carried on by gni.
