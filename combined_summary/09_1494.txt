i recently published my reasons in this matter and directed that the parties bring in draft minutes of orders: australian medic-care company ltd v hamilton pharmaceutical pty limited [2009] fca 1220.
while i gave them the opportunity to put on submissions on costs, i indicated my then present inclination was to make no order as to costs.
