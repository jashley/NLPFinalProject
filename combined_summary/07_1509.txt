291 i find that popple authorised each of these by his direction and control over bugeja who actually drew them.
6 mr popple is metricon's product development manager.
conclusion 292 for these reasons there should be declarations of infringement as against metricon and declarations of authorisation of that infringement as against each of palazzesi and popple.
