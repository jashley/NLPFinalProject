introduction 1 this proceeding concerned the telstra enterprise agreement 2005 --- 2008 between telstra corporation limited ("telstra"), the communications, electrical, electronic, energy, information, postal, plumbing and allied services union of australia ("the cepu"), the community and public section union ("the cpsu") and others ("the 2005 enterprise agreement") and its relationship with the telstra redundancy agreement 2002 ("the tra").
the answer to that issue turned on the proper construction of cl 17.4 of the 2005 enterprise agreement and, in particular whether cl 17.4 of the 2005 enterprise agreement permitted the application of cl 15.3 of the tra to mr mcdonald.
2 the principal issue was whether telstra breached the 2005 enterprise agreement by failing to pay an employee, william mcdonald, a member of the cepu ("mr mcdonald"), his previous rate of salary after he was redeployed to, and later accepted a redundancy package from, a lower paying position.
