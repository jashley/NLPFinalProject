1 just over nine years ago, on 3 march 1998, the yungngora people who live on the noonkanbah pastoral lease, which is held by the yungngora association inc, lodged an application for a native title determination with the national native title tribunal (the tribunal).
cultural knowledge is passed on to children through family group interactions and the community-based school at noonkanbah.
for the people of noonkanbah the prosecution of their application has been a long and difficult path.
