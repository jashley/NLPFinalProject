introduction the court has found that bob mates, in his own right, and the construction, forestry, mining and energy union, through mr mates' conduct, contravened s 43 of the building and construction industry improvement act 2005 (cth) on 15 february 2006, 17 february 2006 and 21 february 2006.
plainly enough, mr mates' action was unlawful.
the court has previously made declarations of contravention that reflect these findings: see cahill v construction, forestry, mining and energy union (no 3) [2009] fca 52.
