1 this is a motion by the applicant ("optiver") to strike out a notice to produce filed by the respondents ("tibra") on 9 august 2007 in relation to an application for pre-action discovery.
this information is not appropriate for pre-action discovery, but rather goes to test the conclusions of mr keldoulis and mr shale in their respective affidavits.
