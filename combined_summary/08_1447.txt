amrs is not an electricity distributor.
it cannot be said that powercor disposed of, or that amrs enjoyed, any part of powercor's business, however characterised.
amrs is, therefore, not a transmittee of powercor's business or part thereof such as to attract the operation of the 1998 award, the 1999 agreement and the 2002 agreement (see [4]) to the employment of mr urquhart by amrs.
