the tribunal had considered the claim as an ethnic chinese and as a chinese christian and considered the cumulative effects.
1 this is an appeal against a judgment of a federal magistrate of 21 june 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal ('the tribunal') signed on 25 october 2006 and handed down on 16 november 2006.
it noted in its decision that many of the reports referred to chinese christians rather than chinese generally because many chinese were christian and that ethnic identity often overlapped with religious identity in the area where the appellant lived.
