it is suggested that there were oral inquiries of mr solaiman, and summons powers in relation to mr solaiman's file and mr solaiman, which could have been pursued by the tribunal.
there is no evidence suggesting that it ever contemplated taking other steps to investigate the applicant's complaints about mr solaiman, nor that the applicant requested or expected this.
bearing in mind that mr solaiman attended the first hearing and contined to communicate with the tribunal via email thereafter, it was unreasonable for the tribunal not to have made some enquiries of mr solaiman regarding the exact nature and circumstances under which the pva was made, who typed it, whether he in fact advised the appellant not to highlight the political claim as claimed.
