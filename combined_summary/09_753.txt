the cockatoo has traditional nesting areas where it returns to breed.
it is acknowledged that the clearance of such native vegetation is likely to have had a significant impact on a listed threatened species included in the endangered category, namely the red-tailed black cockatoo, in contravention of s 18(3) of the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 (cth) (the epbc act).
the south eastern red-tailed black cockatoo ( calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne ) ("the cockatoo") is listed as an endangered species pursuant to sub-section 178(1) of the act.
