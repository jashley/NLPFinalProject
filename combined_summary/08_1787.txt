4 by an application dated 26 april 2006, the taxpayer sought a private ruling from the commissioner as to whether certain liabilities owed by magazines to handbury nominees pty ltd (as trustee for the handbury family trust) ("nominees") and matthew handbury should be included in the step 4 amount under s 711- 45 of the 1997 act .
the liabilities to nominees and mr handbury are thus properly characterized as liabilities "of the leaving entity just before it cease[d] to be a subsidiary member of the consolidated group".
2 the application is brought by way of an appeal under s 14zz of the taxation administration act 1953 (cth) ("the taa"), against the decision of the respondent, the commissioner of taxation, to disallow in full an objection by handbury holdings pty ltd ("the taxpayer") to an assessment to income tax in respect of the year ended 30 june 2005.
