(revised from the transcript) this is, as happens so often in litigation, an argument about the sterile issue of costs.
the plaintiffs are the consignor and consignee of a cargo of steel pipes sent under a bill of lading on the "mv emmagracht" from japan to port kembla.
the owner of the "mv emmagracht" is the first defendant in the proceedings.
