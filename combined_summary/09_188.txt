on 15 february 2008 and 16 february 2008, the first applicant (mr whittaker) was at the airport intending to board singapore airlines flight sq232 bound ultimately for langkawi in malaysia.
section 72d(1) gives a power to make a dpo, not an obligation to make a dpo.
it is also common ground that a purported departure prohibition order (dpo) in respect of mr whittaker was in force.
