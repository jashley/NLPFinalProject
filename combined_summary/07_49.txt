for costs and transfer of proceedings security for costs 1 the general principles governing the provision of security for costs are well known and i need not recite them here.
there is, as i have said on previous occasions, no precise formula in determining what is an appropriate level of security, nor the identification of the stages of the litigation in respect of which security should be provided, if it is to be provided on a staged basis at all.
