these proceedings are related to siam polyethylene co limited v minister of state for home affairs [2009] fca 837 ( the review judgment ).
however, they have raised a distinct and new legal and factual contest between siam polyethylene co limited and the respondents under the customs act 1901 (cth).
for these reasons, i am of opinion that the minister and report 137 failed to make findings specific to siam in relation to the actual measures imposed on it, that addressed the unidentified threat of material injury to qenos that would be caused solely by siam's dumping that the measures were intended to prevent.
