the following issues arise for my determination: whether to refix at all, and if so, when, the requisitioned general meeting; whether to make any order affecting the record date of any requisitioned meeting; and costs.
further, the meeting is an adjourned meeting: (see eg jackson v hamlyn [1953] ch 577, and scadding v lorant (1851) 3 hlc 418).
