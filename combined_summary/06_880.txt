importantly, i held that the first applicant, colorado group limited, was entitled to maintain registration of the "colorado" trade mark only in respect of backpacks and that the respondent, strandbags group pty limited, had infringed the mark by using it on backpacks.
1 earlier this year i handed down judgment which dealt with several aspects of this case.
colorado group was entitled to maintain its registration for backpacks because strandbags group had not established that it (colorado group) was not the first user of the mark for that article.
