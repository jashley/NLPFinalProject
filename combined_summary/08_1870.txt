in substance the applicant challenges the validity of a decision ("the purported decision") of the respondent minister for the environment heritage and the arts ("the minister") purportedly made on 5 september 2008 pursuant to s 74b environmental protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 (cth) ("epbc act") in respect of the applicant's referral no epbc 2008/4366 dated 30 july 2008 ("the referral").
on 29 july 2008 the applicant provided the referral to the minister pursuant to s 68 epbc act for the minister's decision as to whether or not the proposed action the subject of the referral was a controlled action under the epbc act.
2 the applicant claims that the purported decision is of no effect, and has also applied to the court to review what the applicant claims is a failure of the minister to make a decision pursuant to s 75 epbc act as to: (a) whether the proposed action the subject of the referral was a controlled action for the purposes of the epbc act; and (b) which provisions of pt 3, (if any) of the epbc act were controlling provisions for the proposed action the subject of the referral.
