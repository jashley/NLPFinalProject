1 the applicant ("jarra creek") seeks production of documents by the fourth to sixth respondents ("the visy parties") for the purpose of this proceeding.
background 2 aspects of the background to this matter have been briefly discussed in my previous judgments: see jarra creek central packing shed pty ltd v amcor limited [2006] fca 1802 ; jarra creek central packing shed pty ltd v amcor ltd [2007] fca 1559 ; and jarra creek central packing shed pty ltd v amcor limited [2008] fca 391.
although several issues for decision arise in this application, the main issue is whether copy documents, the originals of which may not be privileged, are protected by a privilege claim where they were furnished by the australian competition and consumer commission ("the accc") in response to a notice to produce and requests from the solicitor acting for the visy parties in another proceeding before the court (vid 1650 of 2005 --- australian competition and consumer commission v visy industries holdings pty limited ("the accc proceeding")).
