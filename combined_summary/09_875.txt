the defence force retirement and death benefits act 1973 (cth) ('the dfrdb act') established a scheme for retirement and death benefits for members of the defence force.
the scheme is administered by the defence force retirement and death benefits authority ('the authority') as provided by s 8 of the dfrdb act.
on 24 november 2008 the administrative appeals tribunal ('the tribunal') handed down a decision which found that the respondent had received an overpayment of benefits under the dfrdb act.
