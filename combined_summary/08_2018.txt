this is an application under o 62, rule 4(2)(c) of the federal court rules 1979 to fix a gross sum for the costs i ordered in these proceedings on 7 october 2008.
furthermore this latter hardship will ultimately be dependent upon whether or not a stay is ordered on the costs order, and that, it seems to me, is heaping speculation upon speculation.
