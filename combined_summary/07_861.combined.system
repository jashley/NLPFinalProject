given the nature of the application and the particular circumstances of the case, including mr bellin's familiarity with the matter, i would grant mr bellin the leave he seeks solely for the purposes of my hearing and determining this application.
36 i accept that, as the respondent argued, mr bellin produced very little evidence in support of his application to represent the applicant.
