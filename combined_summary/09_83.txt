in essence, the tribunal rejected the appellant's claims because it did not accept his role in the abvp.
this is an appeal against an order of the federal magistrates court of 17 october 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal in connection with refusal of a protection (class xa) visa under s 65 of the migration act 1958 (cth) ( szlml v minister for immigration &amp; anor [2008] fmca 1219).
insofar as the second and third appeal grounds refer to the appellant being an active member of the abvp, factual findings in respect of the appellant's claims about his activities as a member of the abvp were a matter for the tribunal.
