1 earlier this year i handed down judgment which dealt with several aspects of this case.
importantly, i held that the first applicant, colorado group limited, was entitled to maintain registration of the "colorado" trade mark only in respect of backpacks and that the respondent, strandbags group pty limited, had infringed the mark by using it on backpacks.
i rejected an argument put by colorado group that by reason of its use of the mark on backpacks it was also the proprietor of the mark in respect of bags, wallets, purses and belts.
