the applicant, australian and international pilots association ("aipa") claims that it entered into a binding contract with the respondent, qantas airways limited ("qantas") in the course of negotiating a new certified agreement.
in addition, counsel for qantas foreshadowed that, in the event that aipa's claim based on the alleged contract were to fail, he would seek to argue that s 347 of the wr act (as it then was) does not apply to the whole proceeding, and would seek an order that aipa pay qantas's costs of so much of the proceeding as relates to the claim based on an alleged contract.
certain provisions, which had been part of the certified agreement between aipa and qantas at the time of the judgment in electrolux , had not been included in the new certified agreement because it was thought that their presence might jeopardise the certification of that agreement.
