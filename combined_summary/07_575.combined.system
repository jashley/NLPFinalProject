this finding, in itself, is inconsistent with a suggestion that the adjustment disorder, which arose before 1 december 1988, was the same 'patho-physiological condition' as the delusional disorder.
the reviewable decision before the tribunal (see ss 63 and 64 of the safety, rehabilitation and compensation act 1988 (cth) ('the src act')) was the decision of an independent review officer of the first respondent ('comcare') on 1 december 2004 affirming a determination dated 25 october 2004 that, as at 1 december 2004, the applicant was not presently entitled to compensation under ss 16 and 20 of the src act for two distinct injuries allegedly suffered during his employment with the commonwealth.
