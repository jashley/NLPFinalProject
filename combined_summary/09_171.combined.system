the nature and history of the proceeding the issues in this appeal from a decision of the administrative appeals tribunal ("the tribunal") concern the tribunal's application of s 24 of the veterans' entitlements act 1986 (cth) ("the ve act").
the principal concern of the applicant is whether the tribunal applied the correct test in determining whether the applicant should be entitled to pension at the special rate, pursuant to s 24 of the ve act, on the basis that incapacity from war-caused diseases alone prevented him from continuing to undertake remunerative work that he had been undertaking, and thereby caused him to suffer a loss of salary or wages that he would not be suffering if he were free of that incapacity.
