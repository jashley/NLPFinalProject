1 it appears from the materials before me and from what i am told by the corporate receivers appointed to the sixth defendant on 20 april 2006, that there may have been arrangements in place with companies in and associated with the westpoint group whereby westpoint realty pty ltd (westpoint realty), the sixth defendant, arranged insurance of properties held by those companies and that it did so as one of the insured parties.
4 it appears that the matter has acquired this degree of urgency because of the very short notice upon which mr mcmaster was informed through mr carey, the director of westpoint realty, of this expiry of the insurance.
