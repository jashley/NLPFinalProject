this dispute raises a novel question about the interaction of the undertaking given by a plaintiff under r 41 of the admiralty rules 1988 (cth) to pay to the marshal money in respect of his costs and expenses of arresting a ship with the undertaken given under r 53 by an applicant for release of the ship to pay the costs and expenses of the marshal in relation to the custody of the ship while under arrest.
here, both the plaintiff, emas offshore pte ltd, and the defendant, apc marine pty ltd, which was the owner of the barge that had been arrested, the " apc aussie 1" , paid the marshal the whole of the costs and expenses he had incurred.
