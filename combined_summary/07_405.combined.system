40 i am grateful to counsel for their assistance, in particular counsel for mr holt who appeared pro bono on his behalf.
mr holt's injury was described as "generalised anxiety disorder and adjustment reaction with brief depressive reaction".
mr holt challenged that decision in the administrative appeals tribunal (the aat).
