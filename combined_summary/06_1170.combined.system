leave to appeal was granted by edmonds j.
1 this is an appeal from a decision of raphael fm which dismissed as an abuse of process the appellant's application for review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal: see szfog v minister for immigration [2005] fmca 1081.
although mr clisby does not name the migration agent, it appears that by this time the appellant's migration agent was a mr fahmi hussain since the documents signed by the appellant which were attached to the affidavit of mr clisby were countersigned by mr hussain.
