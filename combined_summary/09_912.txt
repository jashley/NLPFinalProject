the appellant, a citizen of vanuatu, claimed she was the subject of significant domestic violence in that country at the hands of her husband but was not able to be provided --- and would not, if she returned to vanuatu, be provided --- with reasonably effective state protection because of systemic discrimination against women resulting from cultural norms and practices.
the tribunal accepted that the appellant had suffered --- and would, if she returned to vanuatu, face a real chance of suffering --- serious harm from her husband.
