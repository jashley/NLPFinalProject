the question in this proceeding is whether the second respondent, the administrative appeals tribunal ( the tribunal ), failed to provide the applicant, mr julian heyward, with procedural fairness in the manner in which it dealt with mr heyward's application for review of a decision of a delegate of the first respondent, the minister for immigration and citizenship ( the minister ), to cancel mr heyward's visa issued under the migration act 1958 (cth) ( the act ).
mr heyward complains that the tribunal admitted into evidence affidavits tendered by the minister that ought not have been admitted.
