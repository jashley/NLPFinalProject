5 the appellant's sponsor on this application was her husband, william tam who was an australian citizen who was born in sydney on 21 march 1983.
mr tam was both an australian citizen and not prohibited from being a sponsoring spouse so the question before the delegate, and ultimately the tribunal, was whether the appellant was the spouse of mr tam for the purpose of the migration act 1958 (cth) (the act) and the regulations.
