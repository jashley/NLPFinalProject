1 the applicant, mr horn, has been concerned for some time that the construction and lay-out of polling booths used in federal elections do not adequately screen him from observation by others while he is in the process of marking his ballot-paper.
essentially mr horn contends that the voting compartment should have a door, screen or curtain on the front of it to screen the voter.
2 section 206 of the electoral act relevantly reads: polling booths shall have separate voting compartments, constructed so as to screen the voters from observation while they are marking their ballot-papers ... 3 it is helpful and necessary to read s 206 with s 233 which relevantly provides: (1) except as otherwise prescribed the voter upon receipt of the ballot-paper shall without delay: (a) retire alone to some unoccupied compartment of the booth, and there, in private, mark his or her vote on the ballot-paper; (b) fold the ballot-paper so as to conceal his or her vote and: (i) ... deposit it in the ballot-box ...; (ii) ... (c) quit the booth.
