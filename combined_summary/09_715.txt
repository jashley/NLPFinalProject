the claims of contravention of s 45(2) of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) ("the act") were brought against the first to fifth respondents, which comprise five companies in the toll/patrick group (collectively "patrick"); the sixth to eight respondents, which comprise three members of the p&amp;o group (collectively "p&amp;o"); as well as the ninth respondent, australian amalgamated terminals pty limited ("aat"), a joint venture between patrick and p&amp;o which carries on the business of operating the terminals.
introduction in these proceedings, the australian competition and consumer commission ("the commission") claimed that a number of large well-known companies entered into arrangements in 2001 and 2002 which had the purpose or effect, or likely effect, of substantially lessening competition in markets for the supply of automotive terminals at ports in brisbane, sydney and melbourne.
a director of patrick, mr christopher corrigan; a director of aat, mr donald smithwick; and two directors of p&amp;o, mr andrew burgess and mr timothy blood, were said to have aided and abetted, or to have been knowingly involved in, the contraventions.
