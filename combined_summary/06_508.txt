1 this is an application to review a decision of the respondent minister made on 7 october 2004 refusing the applicant a general (residence) class visa based on his marriage to an australian citizen, barbara tenney, who was his nominating spouse for the purposes of the application.
the applicant's migration agent provided various documents on his behalf, including documents which confirmed that the applicant was currently in a relationship with constantine nikolopoulous, an australian citizen and had ceased his relationship with barbara tenney.
from those two declarations, it was apparent that the applicant and ms tenney were no longer in a relationship.
