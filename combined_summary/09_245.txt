this proceeding concerns one aspect of the introduction of a new fisheries management regime to the eastern tuna and billfish fishery (the etbf or the fishery).
on 24 may 2005, the australian fisheries management authority (the authority or afma) determined the eastern tuna and billfish fishery management plan (the management plan) for the fishery.
section 32 of the management plan effected the allocation of statutory fishing rights (sfrs) in the fishery.
