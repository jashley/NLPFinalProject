2 there are two issues before the court: issue 1: whether in each of the years of income, barm derived income in respect of 'management fees' payable to barm by the participants in each budplan project equal to the amount payable by the participants under their contracts with barm at the time those amounts became due and payable under each contract, or only an amount equal to the total of the amounts to which project &amp; general finance pty limited ('pgf') had recourse under the loans made by pgf to the participants?
5 barm was incorporated in australia on 4 september 1995.
3 barm submitted that: (1) as to issue 1, the only income derived by barm in respect of 'management fees' for the budplan projects (other than the melaleuca biotics budplan which is not in dispute in these proceedings) in each of the years of income was that portion of the 'management fees' that barm received from pgf on the repayment of the limited recourse deposit (including interest) made by barm with pgf; and that occurred at the time pgf received repayment of the recourse portion of the loans made by it to participants (being no greater than the amounts of $8,035,539 and $8,565,556 respectively); (2) as to issue 2, the amount of $6,336,420 returned by barm as an 'audit adjustment' in the 1998 year should not be included in barm's assessable income for that year because this amount relates to 'management fees' not derived by barm as income in that year.
