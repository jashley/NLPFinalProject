on 23 december 2004 the applicant wrote to the respondent requesting remission of the penalties.
the total amount of penalty therefore was $1100 which was payable by 29 december 2004.
this is an appeal from a decision of the administrative appeals tribunal ('aat') given on 13 february 2006 in which the aat affirmed the respondent's decision not to remit penalties imposed by the respondent on 2 december 2004 for the applicant's failure to lodge her income tax returns for the years ended 30 june 2001 and 2003.
