having considered a petition which had been filed in the high court and referred for trial in this court i concluded that the australian electoral officer ("aeo") for victoria had erred in ruling that nine ballot-papers, cast in the election for a member of the house of representatives for the division of mcewen, held on 24 november 2007, were formal.
on 2 july 2008 i handed down judgment in mitchell v bailey (no 2) [2008] fca 692.
