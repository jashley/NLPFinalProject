the applicants moved the court by interlocutory process for orders that mr denis angeleri deliver up and transfer to them two motor vehicles and pay to them $37,381.88 plus interest.
that application was amended in the course of the hearing this morning such that the application for the delivery up and transfer of the two motor vehicles was withdrawn and there was substituted an application that an order be made requiring mr angeleri to pay to the applicants the sums which were applied to paying out the loan accounts on the two vehicles.
mr angeleri was, at all relevant times, and is, a director of both amfc and amfl.
