12 also, in official trustee in bankruptcy v raeffaele, in the matter of tindaro raeffaele [2003] fca 328 , allsop j was satisfied that it was appropriate to make an order under s 146 notwithstanding the fact that the bankrupt was plainly solvent.
for the reasons mentioned by allsop j in raeffaele , i am satisfied that there is no point in staying the order.
