1 before me is an application made under s 476a migration act 1958 (cth) ("the act ") wherein the applicant seeks an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the minister for immigration and citizenship ("minister") dated 20 february 2007 to cancel the applicant's resident return subclass 155 visa.
further, any error by the minister in confusing the arrangements with respect to larni and joshua, with those relevant to nikita and darryl, does not in my view mean that the minister has failed to properly consider the best interests of larni and joshua.
there is no evidence before the minister to support that conclusion with respect to [the applicant's] children joshua and larni.
