in all the circumstances, i am not persuaded that i should delve into the day-by-day and hour-by-hour conduct of the trial with a view to ascertaining the extent, if any, to which the respondents' costs were increased as a result of unreasonable acts or omissions on the part of the applicant.
1 on 15 august 2007, i gave final judgment in this proceeding, and gave the parties leave to file written submissions as to costs: [2007] fca 1244.
