introduction 1 this is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of barnes fm dated 24 october 2007.
barnes fm concluded that the refugee review tribunal (rrt) was correct in its decision that it no longer had jurisdiction to review the delegate's decision in relation to the applicant's application because it had previously conducted a proper review of that decision: see s1494/2003 v minister for immigration &amp; anor [2007] fmca 1849 at [9] and [10].
