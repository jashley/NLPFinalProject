for reasons which i then published, i dismissed olivaylle pty ltd's application (olivaylle).
the question is whether, as flottweg ag (formerly flottweg gmbh &amp; co kgaa) (flottweg) sought following the dismissal, olivaylle should be ordered to pay its taxed costs on an indemnity basis?
this is a sequel to the judgment which i delivered on 20 may 2009 in respect of the substantive issues in the proceedings: olivaylle pty ltd v flottweg gmbh &amp; co kgaa (no 4) [2009] fca 522 (the main judgment).
