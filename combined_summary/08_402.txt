the respondent, hobie cat australasia pty ltd, has admitted to engaging in resale price maintenance in contravention of s 48 of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) in its dealings with retailers of its products for a period which commenced in august 2004 and which, for present purposes, ceased in september 2006.
put shortly, the contravening conduct was evidenced in hobie's terms of trade with its dealers which specified the prices below which they were not permitted to sell, or to advertise for sale.
the possibility that hobie was contravening the act was raised by the australian competition and consumer commission with it by letter of 1 november 2006.
