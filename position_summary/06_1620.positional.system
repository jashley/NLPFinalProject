1 this is the second occasion upon which this matter has been before the court by way of an appeal under s 44 of the administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth) against a decision of the administrative appeals tribunal dismissing a claim for compensation under the provisions of the safety, rehabilitation and compensation act 1988 (cth) ("the src act ").
if the tribunal in this matter had been able to deal with the applicant's claim on the basis of what was understood to be the true construction of s 4 of the src act at the time of mr wiegand's first appeal to the tribunal, he would have been awarded the compensation he claimed.
