on 30 november 2009 i published my reasons for judgment in this matter in which i set out the reasons why i had formed the view that the following declarations should be made: (a) a declaration that mr carroll has contravened s 588g(2) of the corporations act 2001 (cth) ("the act"), by failing to prevent the company, the stake man pty limited, from incurring the debts referred to in the schedule to the amended statement of claim; (b) a declaration pursuant to s 1317s(2) of the act, that having regard to all the circumstances of the case, mr carroll ought fairly to be excused for that contravention, and (c) a declaration pursuant to s 1317s(2) of the act, that mr carroll be relieved wholly from any liability to pay to the plaintiffs, pursuant to s 588m of the act, any amount in respect of the loss and damage suffered by creditors of the company, referred to in the schedule to the amended statement of claim.
i said i would hear the parties as to the form of orders which should be made, including any order as to costs.
