2 the reason for the application which is, as the cases show, out of the ordinary, is to be found, amongst other things, in the fact that the second respondent has claimed privilege against self-incrimination as a basis for refusing to meet discovery orders given by greenwood j on 28 april 2006, which orders were in the context of asset preservation orders made against the second respondent.
