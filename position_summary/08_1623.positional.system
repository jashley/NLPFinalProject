background 1 the respondent in the proceeding ("anz") seeks by motion an order that the statement of claim of the applicant ("accc") be struck out pursuant to order 11, r 16(b) of the federal court rules on the footing that the pleading has a tendency to cause prejudice or embarrassment as it fails to plead as required by order 11, r 2(a) material facts necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action said to arise under ss 45(2)(a)(ii) and 45 (2)(b)(ii) of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) ("the act "), having regard to s 45a of the act .
thus, inconsistent with established principle, the pleading fails to define, it is said, the issues with sufficient clarity to enable the respondent to understand and have the opportunity to meet the case made against it and further, the pleading asserts conclusions unsupported by material facts.
