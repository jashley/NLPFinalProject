1 i have before me a notice of motion by which the applicant jacob de bruyn seeks an order that the respondent, minister for justice and customs of the commonwealth, produce for inspection documents referred to in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the affidavit of sally ann nelson filed on behalf of the respondent in proceedings by which jacob de bruyn seeks the issue of the constitutional writ of mandamus on the ground that the respondent has either refused or constructively refused to perform an obligation to determine whether the applicant is to be surrendered in relation to a qualifying extradition offence or offences pursuant to s.22(2) of the extradition act 1988 (cth) ("the act ") within the temporal limitations required by the section, namely, 'as soon as is reasonably practicable having regard to the circumstances, after a person becomes an eligible person' .
2 the application relies upon order 15, rule 11 which relevantly provides that where an affidavit filed by a party refers to any document, the court may, subject to any question of privilege which may arise, order the party to produce the document for inspection by any other party at a time and place specified in the order or to file and serve on any other party a copy of the whole or any part of the document, with or without an affidavit verifying the copy made by a person who has examined the document and the copy.
