1 i do not think the plaintiffs require permission before they give discovered documents to imf (australia) ltd, the company that is providing them with the funds to prosecute this action.
2 early cases, such as richardson v hastings (1884) 7 beav 354 and reynolds v godlee (1858) 4 k &amp; j 88, state that discovery may be refused unless the party gives an undertaking that the documents would not be used for any purpose other than the action then proceeding.
