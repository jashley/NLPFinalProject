introduction 1 this proceeding commenced in march 2005 in a fanfare of claims against the respondent and two of its directors under the trade marks act 1995 (cth), the trade practices act 1974 (cth) and for the tort of passing off, seeking a range of relief --- injunctive, damages, an account of profits, costs and interest.
2 by the time the proceeding came on for hearing a little over 12 months later, the claims against the two directors had been discontinued and all that remained was an infringement claim under the trade marks act 1995 (cth) ('the act') against the respondent which sought injunctive relief restraining the alleged infringement and an order for costs.
