1 this is an application for leave to appeal from the decision given on 8 august 2006 by barnes fm, who declined to make an order nisi on the basis that no arguable case had been established ( applicant s117/2005 v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural affairs &amp; anor [2006] fmca 1169).
the application for leave to appeal from that decision, and the affidavit in support, identified very general grounds of attack upon that decision, but do not tie those grounds back to any part of the reasons of the learned federal magistrate.
