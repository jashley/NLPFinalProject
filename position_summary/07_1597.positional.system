1 this is an application by the australian competition and consumer commission ("accc") for declaratory, injunctive and other relief against the respondents ("storesonline").
in particular, the accc seeks declarations that storesonline has breached certain terms of the undertaking given by it on 24 april 2006 under s 87b of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) ("tpa"), and it seeks injunctions preventing it from committing any further breaches in relation to matters such as giving presentations about computer software packages which it offers from time to time for sale in australia unless it notifies the accc and records the presentations, representing that their products are easy and profitable to use, using testimonials of past clients in a way that is misleading, and informing purchasers of its packages that they can avail themselves of a "cooling-off" period.
