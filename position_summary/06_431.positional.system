1 in this appeal from a decision of a federal magistrate ( szdgb v minister for immigration [2005] fmca 1519) the only issues which realistically could amount to a jurisdictional error by the refugee review tribunal ('the tribunal') are, first, whether the provisions of s 424a(1) of the migration act 1958 (cth) ('the act') were observed and, secondly, whether the tribunal made a mere error of fact by wrongly finding that the appellant had not claimed that her house had been burnt down in her original claim for a protection visa.
