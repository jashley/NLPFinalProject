introduction 1 ms rich has moved the court for orders requiring the respondents for whom the legal firm mallesons stephen jaques acts (hereafter for convenience referred to as "the respondents") to produce for inspection certain classes of documents in respect of which they have claimed client legal privilege.
the issues raised by the motion are: (a) whether the respondents have waived privilege in respect of documents comprising or recording external legal advice to the "management" of pricewaterhousecoopers australia ("pwc") concerning the imposition of certain restrictions on ms rich, and the consequent reduction of her responsibility rating, and requests for such advice; (b) whether the respondents can maintain a claim for client legal privilege in respect of legal advice provided by persons comprising the office of general counsel of pwc ("ogc"); (c) whether the fourteenth respondent, mr stuart edwards, waived privilege in certain legal advice he obtained and provided to other respondents or employees of pwc at a time when, as ms rich contends, there was no common interest between him and them.
