on costs order against legal practitioner introduction 1 when a legal practitioner, whether solicitor or counsel or both, fails in his or her duty to a client and the court by serious incompetence in framing an application and claims for relief and in its presentation, the court may order that the practitioner pay the costs of a party to the proceedings.
