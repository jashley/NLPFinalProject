the origin and nature of the present dispute at an age when the limit of many a man's ambition is frequently little more than a long and tranquil retirement, jorge de moya (mr de moya) embarked upon a bold, new project --- the establishment of a large olive grove near wallowa in the mallee country in central western victoria, the on site production of olive oil of the highest quality from the fruit of the grove and the exporting of that product to an apprehended market in the united states of america.
to observe mr de moya as i did closely, especially during his time in the witness box, but also during his regular attendance in the course of a lengthy trial, as well as to learn in evidence something of his background, is to gain an understanding of why such a limit proved utterly foreign to him.
