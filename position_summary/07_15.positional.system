1 the short issue in this appeal under s 44 of the administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth) is what is meant by the phrase "in a material degree" in the definition of disease in s 4(1) of the safety, rehabilitation and compensation act 1988 (cth) ("the src act ").
that provision defines "disease" to mean any ailment or aggravation of any ailment suffered by an employee "that was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment by the commonwealth".
