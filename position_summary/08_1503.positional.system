2 generally speaking, the issue ventilated in this appeal is concerned with whether australia's double taxation agreements, concluded prior to the time that australia taxed capital gains on a comprehensive basis, deny australia the right to tax the capital gains of enterprises of the other state under australia's capital gains regime in circumstances where australia is denied the right to tax the business profits of such enterprises.
