put shortly, the first issue is whether the tribunal in further conducting a review of a delegate's decision --- the previous decision of a differently constituted tribunal having been set aside by a decision of a federal magistrate --- complied in the circumstances with the obligation imposed on it by s 425 of the migration act 1958 (cth), notwithstanding that the appellant was only invited to appear at the hearing of the invalid decision.
