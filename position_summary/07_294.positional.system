1 i have before me an appeal from the judgment and orders of federal magistrate mcinnis of 4 december 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal ('the tribunal') by which the tribunal affirmed a decision of the delegate of the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant.
two preliminary matters might be dealt with conveniently now and they are that: an application has been made for leave, consistent with authority, to join the refugee review tribunal as a second respondent in the proceedings and i give that leave; secondly, leave has been sought to amend the title of the first respondent from minister for immigration and multicultural affairs to minister for immigration and citizenship' and i give leave to make that change.
