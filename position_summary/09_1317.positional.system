the original statement of claim this proceeding, in amended form, is brought by the applicant as a representative party on behalf of group members who are commercial manufacturers of "rubber compounds" and "rubber products".
it is alleged that they were forced to pay higher prices for these products because of a global cartel arrangement to which the first, third and fourth respondents ("the foreign respondents") were party with other manufacturers and suppliers of rubber chemicals.
