the federal court of australia convenes here at aurukun today on country to make and explain the reasons for making orders under s 87 of the native title act 1993 (cth) ("the act") that take effect as a determination of the traditional native title rights and interests of the wik and wik way peoples in the lands and waters of the determination area over which they assert a continuous exercise of traditional rights and interests by their people prior to and since sovereignty.
the land and waters of the determination area described in detail in the schedule to the orders made today, and also illustrated as areas 1 and 2 on the plan annexed to the orders, are more broadly described as the land and waters on the western side of cape york peninsula landward of the high water mark at mean spring tide of the sea of the gulf of carpentaria, bounded to the north by the embley river and to the south by the edward river and extending in the east to the upper reaches of the watercourses that drain into the gulf of carpentaria.
