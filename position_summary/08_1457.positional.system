introduction 1 this proceeding concerns whether an allotment of shares was issued for an improper purpose and is a rehearing of a trial heard by another judge of this court as ordered by the full court on 15 august 2008.
for the reasons which follow, after a consideration of the evidence before me on this rehearing, i have come to the view that the allotment was not for an improper purpose and was made bona fide in the best interests of life therapeutics limited ('lfe').
