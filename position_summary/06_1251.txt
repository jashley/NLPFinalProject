1 on 5 september 2006 i ordered that the decision of the delegate of the native title registrar, refusing registration of the claim the subject of these proceedings, be set aside and that the registrar include particulars of the claim in the register of native title claims.
i observed that the applicant had sought an order back-dated to the time when the claim should have been registered, because notification was subsequently given of future acts and the ability to negotiate with those concerned in these acts had been lost.
