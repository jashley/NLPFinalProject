ms yousif alleges that the bank terminated her employment contrary to s 659(2)(a) and/or (e) of the workplace relations act 1996 (cth) (the act) which provides that: an employer must not terminate an employee's employment for any one or more of the following reasons, or for reasons including any one or more of the following reasons: (a) temporary absence from work because of illness or injury within the meaning of the regulations; ... (e) the filing of a complaint, or the participation in proceedings, against an employer involving alleged violation of laws or regulations or recourse to competent administrative authorities; proof of the case is governed by s 664 which, relevantly, provides: (a) it is not necessary for the employee to prove that the termination was for a proscribed reason; but (b) it is a defence in the proceedings if the employer proves that the termination was for a reason or reasons that do not include a proscribed reason... the only issue in dispute is whether the bank has established a defence under s 664(b).
