it appears from the evidence of the receiver, mr mcmaster, that certain of the relevant insurances are about to expire at close of business today, if they haven't already expired, and that there may be an expectation on the part of the various commercial property owners, to whom i have referred, that the insurance will have been renewed by the sixth defendant.
