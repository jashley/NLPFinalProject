the grounds of appeal which he advances are as follows: the federal magistrate erred in failing to find that the administrative appeals tribunal (aat): (a) incorrectly interpreted and/or applied the meaning of the expression "special circumstances" pursuant to s 1184k of the social security act 1991 (cth) (the social security act ) to the circumstances of the appellant's case; (b) erred in law in holding that the appellant's circumstances were not special circumstances because he still had $13,000 available from the settlement moneys, that he and his family continued to live out of town for a number of reasons, that they had two cars available to them and that their living circumstances had not undergone substantial change; (c) should have made a finding whether it accepted all of the appellant's un-contradicted evidence in relation to the claim of "special circumstances" and; (d) gave inadequate reasons for its decision that there were no "special circumstances" in this case.
