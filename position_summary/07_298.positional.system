1 this is an appeal from a determination of the superannuation complaints tribunal ('the tribunal') affirming a decision of the first respondent ('the trustee') not to reinstate the applicant's account in a superannuation fund, of which the trustee is trustee, in the circumstances outlined below.
2 the background facts are largely not in dispute although the trustee, through its counsel, made it clear that because the tribunal did not make, or was not even in a position, having regard to the state of the evidence before it, to make any finding of fact that the application for payment was a forgery, the trustee was not to be taken to be making any concession or admission on this factual issue.
