the appellant is the trustee of the estate of the respondent in bankruptcy and contends that federal magistrate coker made findings unsupported by the evidence that; actions taken by the trustee in the course of the administration of the estate were 'unprofessional'; costs, charges, expenses and remuneration incurred in the administration of the estate were 'extremely excessive'; and the refusal of the trustee to be satisfied of the matters contemplated by s 153a of the bankruptcy act 1966 (cth) ('the act') until complaints made by the respondent concerning the trustee's conduct of the administration were resolved, amounted to 'extreme and inappropriate bullying'.
