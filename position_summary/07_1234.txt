introduction this case raises questions concerning the duty of a company administrator when exercising a casting vote on the question whether the company is to execute a deed of company arrangement (doca) under pt 5.3a of the corporations act 2001 (cth) (the act).
the case presents a not uncommon picture --- a conflict between creditors favourably disposed to those individuals who control the company and to the proposed doca on the one hand, and a substantial unrelated creditor who would prefer a winding up on the other.
