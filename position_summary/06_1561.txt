1 i have before me an application for an interlocutory injunction made on behalf of prescience communications limited to restrain, pending the trial of the proceedings, the commissioner of taxation from copying documents held in an electronic form on a computer described in the material as a 'tower' computer and information held on three hard drives to be used in conjunction with either the tower computer or other computer equipment.
the application came before the court on an urgent basis on tuesday, 14 november 2006 at 3.00pm on the footing that the proposed respondent, the commissioner of taxation, has and retains possession of the computer and three hard drives and proposes to implement a protocol which would result in the 'imaging' or copying of the documents encoded on the computer and hard drives.
