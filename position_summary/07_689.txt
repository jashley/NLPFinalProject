the issues 1 the primary concern of the parties in this matter is to have the court determine whether the non-award of a civil engineering subcontract to the applicant, for the construction of gravity and rising mains and pipework at moruya heads, can be attributed to wrongful bad-mouthing of the applicant by the respondent's department of public works or one of its successor departments ('the department') in respect of the applicant's performance of a contract with the albury city council for the kremur street pumping station (part of the council's sewerage works), to a wrongful placement of the applicant on the department's provisional contractors' review list, to a wrongful description by the department of the applicant as a litigious contractor and as an unsuitable contractor and/or to a breach by the respondent of an agreement made 7 january 1994 said to have arisen from the settlement of a dispute between one of the applicant's related companies and the department in respect of a norah head civil engineering contract.
