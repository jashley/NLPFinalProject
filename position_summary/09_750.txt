introduction sub-section 340(2) of the workplace relations act 1996 (cth) ('the wr act'), provided that: (2) an employee collective agreement or union collective agreement is approved if: (a) the employer has given all of the persons employed at the time whose employment will, or would but for the operation of an itea that has passed its nominal expiry date, be subject to the agreement a reasonable opportunity to decide whether they want to approve the agreement; and (b) either: (i) if the decision is made by a vote - a majority of those persons who cast a valid vote decide that they want to approve the agreement; or (ii) otherwise--a majority of those persons decide that they want to approve the agreement.
under the wr act, the approval of an employee collective agreement was significant because it was an essential prerequisite for such an agreement coming into operation; and once the agreement came into operation, it bound the employer and "all persons whose employment is, at any time when the agreement is in operation, subject to the agreement": see s 351.
