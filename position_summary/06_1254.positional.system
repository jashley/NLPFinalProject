introduction 1 i have before me an application made by the australian securities and investments commission ('asic') for an order that the green pacific energy limited ('gpel') a stock exchange listed entity be wound up in insolvency on the ground that gpel is insolvent as it has failed to discharge, on all the evidence, the onus it bears of proving that it is not insolvent (see: s 459c(3) of the corporations act 2001 ('the act') having regard to the presumption arising by operation of s 459c(2)(a) of the act arising out of gpel's failure on 6 june 2006 to comply with a statutory demand (meeting the requirements of s 459f of the act) served upon it by techcomm simulation pty ltd ('techcomm').

2 further, asic seeks an order for the winding up of gpel on the ground that the 'directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own interests rather than in the interests of the members as a whole, or in any manner whatsoever that appears to be unfair or unjust to other members' (s 461(1)(e) of the act) and on the further ground that the court is of the opinion that 'it is just and equitable that the company be wound up' (s 461(1)(k)).
