the nature and history of the proceeding the question that arises in this appeal is whether the migration review tribunal ("the tribunal"), the second respondent to the appeal, was wrong in holding that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the appellant's application for review of a decision to cancel his visa.
having taken steps to advise the appellant that his application for waiver of the fee normally required in conjunction with an application for review had been refused, the tribunal proceeded to dismiss the application for review on the basis that it had no jurisdiction.
