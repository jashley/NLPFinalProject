2 the appellant contends that federal magistrate scarlett erred by failing to find that a decision of the tribunal based on reasoning that was 'irrational and illogical' and based upon 'unwarranted assumptions' was vitiated by jurisdictional error; by finding that the tribunal was not under a duty 'to make reasonable enquiries as to the veracity of documents before dismissing them'; by finding that 'misrepresentation of evidence by the tribunal did not constitute jurisdictional error'; and by finding that the tribunal 'did not apply the wrong test' in determining the matters before it.
