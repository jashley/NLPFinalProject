1 this is an appeal from the federal magistrates court ( szejf v minister for immigration [2005] fmca 1315) which dismissed the appellant's application for prerogative relief under s 39b of the judiciary act 1903 (cth) directed to the refugee review tribunal, in respect of its decision to affirm the decision of the delegate of the minister to refuse a protection visa to the appellant.
2 the issues raised in the appeal are whether the tribunal: (a) failed to give reasons for its decision and instead made unsupported assertions; (b) failed to understand and to give proper, genuine and real consideration to the appellant's claims that he had a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of religion or political opinion, having found that he was banished from the region in pakistan in which he lived and worked because of his 'liberal thinking'.
