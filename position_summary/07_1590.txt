1 i propose to give my reasons forthwith rather than subject either ms jeilles, in particular, or the commonwealth to the expense and also the anxiety of a reserved decision and wondering what the outcome might be.
i should indicate that i'm able to do that because i've had the benefit of written submissions, in advance, from ms jeilles and also from ms copley on behalf of the commonwealth, which have been spoken to this morning in a very precise way, with respect, by each of the applicant and the respondent's representative.
