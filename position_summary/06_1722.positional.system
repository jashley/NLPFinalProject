1 i have before me an application made under s 459g of the corporations act 2001 (cth) ('the act') for an order setting aside a statutory demand dated 31 august 2006 served on the plaintiff on 6 october 2006 by the defendant in an amount of $10,567.31 together with an affidavit in support of the demand sworn by david swinnerton on 31 august 2006, the managing director of the defendant.
mr swinnerton deposes to a belief that the amount recited in the statutory demand is due and payable to the creditor and a belief that there is no genuine dispute concerning the existence or amount of the debt recited in the demand.
