the issues 1 the principal issues which arise in this case are: (a) whether an appellant in a migration appeal should be granted leave to amend his notice of appeal on the day of the hearing where the consequences of allowing the amendment would be to permit the appellant to argue matters not raised below, some of which were expressly abandoned by counsel appearing for the appellant in the lower court; (b) whether, regardless of the merits of the matter, the court ought to refuse constitutional writ relief in circumstances where for over four years the appellant had taken no action to challenge the decision of the refugee review tribunal ('the tribunal') handed down on 29 april 1996 of which he now complains; (c) whether the tribunal denied the appellant procedural fairness by failing to put to the appellant concerns which it had about inconsistencies between the appellant's case as presented to the minister's delegate and his case as advanced before the tribunal and/or by failing to put to the appellant what it perceived to be deficiencies in the appellant's case; (d) whether the tribunal committed jurisdictional error by failing to properly consider the risk of persecution were the appellant to return to bangladesh; (e) whether the tribunal committed jurisdictional error by failing to address whether the appellant's claimed fear of persecution was causally connected to his political opinion.

the duty of the tribunal as an inquisitor to act fairly 2 in adversarial litigation there is a fundamental principle that a party should not be permitted to submit that a witness has lied on oath without it first being suggested to the witness that his evidence is false and, if the reason for the suggestion is not self-evident, the basis on which the suggestion is advanced so as to give the witness an opportunity to deal with the suggestion.
