this is an appeal, pursuant to s 46 of the superannuation (resolution of complaints) act 1993 (cth) ('the complaints act'), from a determination of the superannuation complaints tribunal ('the tribunal') whereby the tribunal determined to set aside the decision under review and substituted its own decision that the applicant pay the respondent the sum of $380,000 less the amount of all pensions already paid to him in respect of the relevant pension plan plus compound interest at the rate the respondent would have earned if the $380,000 had been invested in the income option of a fund known as the harry wallace personal pension plan (formerly named the harry wallace personal superannuation fund) ('the fund') from 24 march 2000 to the date of payment.
the fund was established by trust deed dated 24 march 1995 ('the 1995 trust deed').
