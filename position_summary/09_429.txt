the first order sought by mr tsekouras in his application filed on 8 december 2008 is: ' the applicant seeks a third party claim as this bankruptcy should never have been instigated by peter olsen on behalf of the insolvency and trustee service australia '.
the bankruptcy to which the application refers arises from a sequestration order made against mr tsekouras' estate on 14 june 2000 by an order of hely j on the application of mr tsekouras' former solicitor, ms evangelinidis ('the sequestration order').
