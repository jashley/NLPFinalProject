it was submitted on behalf of the appellant in the federal magistrates court that he had never claimed to be a naxalite, and that he was a non-violent naxalite.
the appellant contended that this was an inaccurate assessment of the part of the naxalite movement which the appellant was associated with.
the basis for this submission seemed to be the contention that the tribunal wrongly assessed the appellant's political affiliation and the nature of the naxalite movement.
