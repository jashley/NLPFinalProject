in so doing the tribunal finds that the chance is remote that he will be targeted for serious harm by maoists or government authorities.
the appellant also claimed that whilst he was a hotel manager in kathmandu, he had come to the adverse attention of maoists after he dismissed workers affiliated with a maoist-dominated union.
this behaviour does not appear to be consistent with that of a person who is concerned for his safety because of fear of being harmed by the maoists and the government agents.
