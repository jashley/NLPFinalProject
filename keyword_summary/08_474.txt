5 mr denoon is a director of ccpl and cpl.
mr denoon says that it was his view that the investment in rothwells by cpl as trustee of the carringbush trust was rendered worthless.
at the time of the acquisition of the rothwells shares, cpl was acting as trustee for the carringbush unit trust (the 'carringbush trust').
