counsel for the committees also drew my attention to the decision of the court of appeal of the australian capital territory in regina v doogan; ex parte lucas-smith [2005] actsc 74 ; (2005) 193 flr 239, especially at 279-280 [179]-[180] where higgins cj, crispin and bennett jj referred to the principles in hardiman 144 clr at 35-36 and brennan j's remarks in fagan 150 clr at 681-682.
the hardiman principle has been applied recently by the new south wales court of appeal in campbelltown city council v vegan [2006] nswca 284 but the circumstances were not similar to those in the present proceedings.
