' 6 mr cox said that while reviewing discovery provided by sirtex and documents obtained in answer to subpoenas issued by the university, a number of documents had been identified suggesting that sirt 1 was developed or discovered by dr gray prior to april 1997.
sirtex says it is wrong to assume, as the university evidently does, that the invention as so claimed correlates to the product or technology referred to as 'sirt 1' in the proposed pleading and the documents exhibited to mr cox's affidavit.
