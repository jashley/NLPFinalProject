the tribunal also considered that the trustee covenants in s52(2)(b) and (c) of the sis act were relevant to this complaint.
the trustee was required to formulate and give effect to an investment strategy for the fund by s52(2)(f) of the sis act.
in this context, the word "even" meant that the formulation of investment strategy was still required to comply with s52(2)(f) of the sis act.
