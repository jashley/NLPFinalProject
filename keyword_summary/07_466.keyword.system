2 earlier i had found that by causing bgr to pay their legal costs associated with the proceedings, triad and cordato partners services had acted oppressively to food improvers (see order 3(a) made on 12 february 2007: the food improvers pty ltd v bgr corporation pty ltd (no 3) [2007] fca 97).
i overlooked the plaintiffs' submissions that i should frame the relief more generally than just affecting bgr.
