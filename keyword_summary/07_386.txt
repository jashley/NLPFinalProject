these include the reimbursement of fees and commissions to lpos; to supply products requested by lpos; to communicate changes of products and services with current licensees.
at [36], the tribunal noted the evidence of mr keen that the list of lpos was created and maintained to enable australia post to: (a) pay lpos the fees and commissions built into the lpo network in respect of the products and services provided by lpos; (b) market new products and new services which are non-mandatory and which are available from the australia post approved range; (c) be able to notify current lpos of changes in product; (d) be able to communicate with lpos generally as part of the management of the lpo network including, for example, sending the licensee bulletin providing update information.
i accept that the examples given are convincing evidence that australia post and lpos compete with private sector bodies.
