the hearing of qud 389/2005 is currently scheduled to commence in mt isa on monday 28 august 2006.
associate: dated: 8 august 2006 counsel for the applicant: d o'gorman solicitor for the applicant: robert bax &amp; associates counsel for the respondent: je murdoch sc and cj murdoch solicitor for the respondent: crown law date of hearing: 26 july 2006 date of judgment: 8 august 2006 austlii: copyright policy | disclaimers | privacy policy | feedback url: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/fca/2006/1015.html
in my view, proceeding in late august in light of the aforementioned possibilities canvassed by the applicants could cause additional and unnecessary expense and inconvenience to the parties, the witnesses and the court that would outweigh the inconvenience of rescheduling the trial date in these circumstances.
