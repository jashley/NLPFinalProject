reliance was placed on dotter v evans [1969] vr 41; casella v casella [1969] vr 49 and re purkiss [1999] vsc 386 ; [1999] 3 vr 223.
casella v casella involved the failure by a husband to comply with a court order to transfer certain land to his wife as part of property arrangements following a divorce.
i think, however, that if one follows the order made by lush j in ritzos v ritzos [1970] vr 150 to ensure the old certificate is cancelled and a new duplicate certificate issued, then some of the difficulties that i had foreseen in dotter v evans will be overcome.
