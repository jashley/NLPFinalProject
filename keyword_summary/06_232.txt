as to the claim of public interest immunity, the applicant says this: (a) the position adopted by ms blackburn has no application in relation to those documents passing between the attorney-general's department and the ahc nor any application to documents from the ahc to the attorney-general's department which do not reveal the content of communications with south african authorities.
