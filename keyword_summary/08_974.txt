there will be an order that beconwood's costs be costs in the administration of opes prime.
it involves a dispute between rival claimants (beconwood and anz) over shares "lent" to opes prime.
the position is that if a trustee seeks advice from the court as regards how the trust instrument should be interpreted, or how the trust should be administered, to enable him to properly to execute his duties he will have his costs paid out of the trust estate: in re beddoe; downes v cottam [1893] 1 ch d 547 ; in re buckton; buckton v buckton [1907] 2 ch d 406.
