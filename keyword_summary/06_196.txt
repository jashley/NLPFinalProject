the sole director of tjv and melbourne transit is mr goss.
mr goss replied that there was no need for hardcorp to employ a fedfa shop steward because hardcorp would not be employing a crane crew.
mr goss said that, initially, hardcorp was going to hire a crane with staff and then have a crane company use their manpower on tjv's crane.
