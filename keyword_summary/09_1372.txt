the appellants had argued that they had a well founded fear of persecution in sierra leone because of their support for a political party known as the sierra leone peoples party ("the slpp"), as well as their support for the former president of sierra leone, a mr kabbah.
that article documented persecution and harassment of slpp members by operatives of another political party known as the apc.
those highlighted portions contain the following propositions: (a) there was no evidence which suggested that supporters of the slpp or the former president were being singled out to be attacked by the apc or its supporters; (b) the appellants' submission of 1 august 2008 referred to claims made by the slpp about violence against slpp members ahead of elections in june 2008; (c) the tribunal rejected that submission because if it were true it would have been made by the slpp itself.
