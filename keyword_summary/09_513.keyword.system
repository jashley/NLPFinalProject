all of the directors of aurium attended the board meeting, namely, mr peter remta, chairman, mr terry quinn, mr thomas percy, mr peter benson and mr edward saunders.
in this case it appears that none of the relevant directors mr remta, mr quinn and mr benson had given a formal written standing notice about their interests.
mr quinn's relationship with gpn is quantatively different to that of mr benson in that mr quinn has a demonstrated indirect interest in gpn through jamora which holds 4.2% of the issued capital.
