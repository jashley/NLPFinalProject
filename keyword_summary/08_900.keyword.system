3 recently i declined to make an order for costs against an unsuccessful party in litigation raising environmental issues: blue wedges inc v minister for the environment, heritage and the arts [2008] fca 8 ; (2008) 165 fcr 211 at [73] .
this was spectacularly irrelevant.
unlike blue wedges , the present case did not raise any novel questions of general importance about the operation of the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 (cth) or any difficult questions of construction.
