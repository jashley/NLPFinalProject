i take this view because: &#8226; although his honour quite properly made detailed reference to gao v zhang [2005] vr 380 in his judgment, and clearly sought to achieve fairness between the parties with respect to his orders, the facts in the present proceedings bear few similarities to those in gao v zhang [2005] vr 380 where the court considered that the conduct of the applicant justified the relevant order.
