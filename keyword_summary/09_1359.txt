to that end, jax has offered to enter into a supply deed with the receiver that grants a licence to the receiver to use the "jax" and "jax quickfit" names and provide trading stock (on credit) necessary to operate the business at the premises (the deed ).
7 the receiver currently has an ad hoc agreement with jax that entitles him to utilise the jax brand without charge and access the services of an experienced jax manager and trading stock from major wheel and tyre manufacturers.
6 following that event, the receiver formed the view that the quickest, most practical and cost-effective way to begin trading was to utilise the services and branding of jax quickfit franchising systems pty limited (acn 112 050 058) ( jax ), as the premises had previously been operated as a jax franchise.
