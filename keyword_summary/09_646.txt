in opposing proposed orders 1 and 2, qantas read the affidavits of philippa hannay and beverley newbold.
at [86] of the reasons, i summarised the applicant's trade practices claim as follows: following qantas's notification to the group members that it was introducing a fuel surcharge and that it would appear under a special box in the "tax/fee/charge" box on all tickets, qantas: 1. had, until about may 2008, required each group member to include the said "fuel surcharge" in the "tax/fee/charge" box on all paper tickets; and 2. until the present time, and continuing, required each group member to include the amount representing the fuel surcharge within the amount code on receipts for electronic tickets within the field "taxes/charges".
ms hannay's evidence in particular shows that, in the main, paper tickets issued on behalf of qantas have only been used in exceptional circumstance since may 2008.
