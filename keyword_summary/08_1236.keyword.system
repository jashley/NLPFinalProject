2 the appellant is a citizen of the united kingdom, who arrived in australia on 29 october 1982.
his fear of persecution is based on the existence in the united kingdom of vigilante groups, who target paedophiles, or suspected paedophiles, for assault and even death.
the tribunal therefore accepted that the appellant has some public profile as a child sex offender or paedophile in the united kingdom.
