in my opinion, that is the better reading of the reasons of spigelman cj in switz pty ltd v glowbind pty ltd (2000) 48 nswlr 661 at 674 [56].
mr davidson drew my attention to a decision of white j in radiancy (sales) pty ltd v bimat pty ltd [2007] nswsc 962 ; (2007) 25 aclc 1216 where at 1226 [64] his honour said this: the question is not whether the debt demanded by radiancy (sales) is determinative of bimat's insolvency.
for completeness, it should be noted that in my opinion two justices of this court have approached the matter on the more narrow view and have certainly thought themselves to be implementing the position in switz: see hvac construction (qld) pty ltd v energy equipment engineering pty ltd (2002) 44 acsr 169 at 184 [53] per french j; web wealth pty ltd v helimount pty ltd [2006] fca 1376 at [43] - [45] per besanko j.
