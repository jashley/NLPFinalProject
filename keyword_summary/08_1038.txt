from october 2001, at dr lam's suggestion, amc inserted a small leaflet into the box of each unit of the 10% urea cream which it received from hamilton before that unit was despatched to amc customers.
i directed amc's employees to purchase samples of fuyunhon 10% urea cream 50g from a range of dispensaries and retailers and note whether the boxes of the samples purchased contained amc's advertising leaflets, referred to above.
the purpose of this strategy was to permit amc to distinguish those products in the market which were supplied by amc from those which were not, hence the reference in the quotation above to boxes containing amc's advertising leaflets.
