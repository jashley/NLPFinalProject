to require telstra to unmask all documents masked for relevance creates a real danger of disruption to the trial, as the applicants consider the significance of the unmasked material and perhaps seek to put fresh material to witnesses who have already given evidence.

in several other instances, telstra has provided unmasked copies of documents to the applicants following complaints by them.
