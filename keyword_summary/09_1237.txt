in a statement accompanying his pva, the applicant claimed to be an active member of the dravida munnetra kazhagam political party (dmk) who actively support the rights of the dalit caste.
in those circumstances the tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant was a member of the dmk.
as a result, the applicant was persecuted and assaulted by the higher castes who disapproved of his support for dalit rights, particularly his participation in the demolition of a wall between high-caste and scheduled caste areas in a nearby village.
