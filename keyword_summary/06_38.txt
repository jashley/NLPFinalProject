1 on 4 october 2005, crennan j dismissed the appellant's application to the court for relief against the respondents for alleged infringement of the appellant's registered trade mark for the words 'the hunchback of notre dame': see christodoulou v disney enterprises inc [2005] fca 1401.
with respect, this would mean, in christodoulou's view, as can be clearly seen from his affidavit and notice of appeal, simply using the words "the hunchback of notre dame" in any context at all is "use as a trade mark".
her honour, applying a line of well-established authority, concluded that the allegedly infringing uses by the respondents of the words 'the hunchback of notre dame' in relation to films and related products were not uses of the words 'as a trade mark'.
