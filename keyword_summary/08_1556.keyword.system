indeed i also note that, in accordance with my orders of 9 august 2006, the respondents filed considerable additional evidence upon which they relied at trial, including an affidavit of mr burns (filed 28 july 2006), affidavits of mr strahley (filed 11 august 2006 and 18 august 2006), and affidavits of mr harrison, mr breed and mr bailey (filed 18 august 2006).
the applicants' case against mr strahley was intertwined with their case against the first respondent --- an inevitable approach in my view given mr strahley's position as managing director of the first respondent.
