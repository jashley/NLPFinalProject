6 one specific issue raised by ms penhall-jones was whether costs should be allowed to the respondent for senior counsel.
i accept ms penhall-jones' submission that any order for costs should be made on the basis that she pay party/party costs and not indemnity costs.
on 28 june 2007 i dismissed the appellant's appeal against a judgment of the federal magistrates court ( penhall-jones v state of nsw [2007] fca 925).
