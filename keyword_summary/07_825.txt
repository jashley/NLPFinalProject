8 the 'chain of supply' of the defective hard drives is said to have been uncommon, in that the first respondent manufactured the hard disk drives, those drives were then imported into australia and received by the second respondent, and the second respondent then sold the drives to resellers from whom the applicant bought the drives.
the 'defective' hard disk drives allegedly contained a manufacturing defect which caused 'significantly in excess of 50% of the defective [hard disk drives] to fail in a period of 1 month to 18 months after commencement of use..., and caused many further of the defective [hard disk drives] to fail after 18 months of use but before 5 years of use'.
common marketing of the goods worldwide was alleged to have occurred under the banner "fujitsu"', and in that latter regard, the applicant relies on a brochure created by fujitsu that appears at page 1 of exhibit 'rp-1' attached to the affidavit of robert paul sworn on 26 march 2007.
