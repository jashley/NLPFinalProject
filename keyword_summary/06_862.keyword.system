given the matters that have been proved, i accept mr cobden's submissions that this is appropriate.

i think the better reading of o 25b, and not having had the assistance of opposing counsel, is the one put to me by mr cobden that the flexibility and amplitude of o 25b r 3 would be undermined if one read the search order as limited to the precise cause of action known.
