33 the question of whether a breach of s 424b(3)(b) of the act resulted in jurisdictional error was raised in szdql v minister for immigration multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fca 769 (" szdql") .
it seems to me that what sackville j said in szdql as to the object of s 424b(3)(b) applies equally to s 424b(2).
38 support for the view i have expressed as to the object of the provision may be found in sackville j's observation in szdql at [50] as to the statutory purpose of s 424b(3)(b).
