res judicata can operate as a bar to a judicial review application in these circumstances: see mzwhw v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fca 466 (" mzwhw ") at [11] referring to re wong v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs (2004) 204 alr 722 (" wong ") at [71].
18 the federal magistrate's decision was, so it seems to me, a final decision: see mzwhw at [6]; also szeeo v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fca 546 at [8] - [11] ; nadz v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fca 975 at [29] ; and mzwzl v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fca 1475 at [11] .
nothing has been established that would attract the discretion that forms part of the anshun estoppel doctrine: see generally wong at [49], [61]-[64], [149].
