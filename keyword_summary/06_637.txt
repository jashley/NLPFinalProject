3 those documents comprise 7 boxes of documents filed in conjunction with the affidavit of mr bruce virgo which are the documents delivered into the possession of the independent supervising solicitors consequent upon execution of an anton pillar order.
however, that order has not been formally made and accordingly i propose to dispose of the application for the return of the documents by making an order in the following terms in order to regularise the re-delivery of the documents to facilitate completion of discovery.
