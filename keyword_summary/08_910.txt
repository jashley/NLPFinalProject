8 the tribunal also found: however, the tribunal is satisfied that in the few recent instances when sla members have been targeted by the authorities, hezbollah, or any one else in lebanon, those targeted were easily identifiable members of the sla, mostly from southern lebanon where the sla was active, and implicated in activities suggesting collaboration with israel.
the appellant submits that the tribunal's finding that '... those targeted were easily identifiable members of sla, mostly from southern lebanon...' did not take account of former sla members who do not satisfy such profile.
the tribunal finds that the applicant will not attract the adverse interest of hezbollah, or anyone else opposed to the sla in lebanon, as he is a person from northern lebanon who ceased to be involved with the sla many years ago.
