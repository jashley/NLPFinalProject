8 in my view i do have power to make the order sought by wcni.
the wcni has, therefore, taken the step of coming to this court as a supporting creditor.
i will also order that the costs of wcni, as supporting creditor, be paid out of the assets of the defendant, and in particular that those costs include the costs of wcni of and incidental to proceedings no.
