mr heath continues: ... the use of pv applications based on false protection claims by chinese and certain other nationals to extend their stay in australia for reasons other than a genuine need for australia's protection is a systemic problem at present.
... my experience and analysis of these cases indicates that after exhausting their attempts to remain in australia a significant proportion of those taking this path marry australian citizens before they depart australia, apply for spouse migration and if successful later divorce their australian sponsor and "reconcile" with their former chinese spouse who they then sponsor themselves.
current statistics indicate that the highest number of pv applications currently being lodged are made by chinese nationals, many based on false or frivolous claims.
