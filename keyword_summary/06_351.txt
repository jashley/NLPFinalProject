dr. unwin in his report has formulated a series of questions by which dr. unwin seeks to deal with the extent to which the identified condition might be ameliorated or alleviated by reference to or through the use by the applicant of the assistance dogs.
4 it may be that in the proceedings, mr forest might wish to put propositions to dr. unwin as to the basis upon which dr. unwin has expressed his opinion and whether the expression of those views can sit comfortably with either a failure to observe either of the dogs in question or with a failure to observe the behavioural interaction between either of the dogs and mr forest but it is correct to say those are matters which ought to be put to dr. unwin as part of the cross examination of dr. unwin as to the basis for the expression of his opinion.
3 it seems to me that upon a proper reading of the report of dr. unwin, the report does not do those things.
