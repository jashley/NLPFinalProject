10 such a limited stay and injunction is open to be made, although the court has ordered the dissolution of the injunctions already made: erinford properties ltd v cheshire county council [1974] 1 ch 261 at 267-268.
13 in my opinion, it is appropriate to grant a stay and to extend the injunctions: australia and new zealand banking group ltd v merribee pastoral industries pty limited [1998] 84 fcr 367.
