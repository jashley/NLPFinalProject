the ambit of the dispute between mr mcguire and mr savage centres on the extent to which mr savage identified the content of the restrictions contained in his employment contract.
18 on 7 may 2007, mr peter mcguire interviewed mr savage for the purpose of offering him employment with the respondents.
he met with mr michael tiernan, challenge dairy's purchasing officer for the site, who said that mr nelson had just missed seeing the third respondent and mr rory mcguire who had been at the site for a meeting 10 minutes before mr nelson arrived.
