3 the defence of the companies which mr gulson controls to the plaintiffs' claim asserts that the allegations concerning mr gulson's conduct amount to a ruse to deflect responsibility for the refusal by mr bax and a senior employee of the bgr group, mr gobert, in late may 2005 to continue to participate in business travel and arrangements overseas that were of significance with the bgr group's business.
there will also be, as there already is in the affidavits of mr bax which have been read, evidence making assertions about or observations of mr gulson's behaviour and apparent state of health.
