his honour did not properly interpret s 28a sd act .
12 first, the appellant does not appear to cavil with the findings of his honour that: &#8226; there are no facts alleged by the appellant that could amount to any sexual harassment of the appellant by or on behalf of the second respondent or any of professor gardner, dr bowey, marnie king, luisa nocella, ann stewart, dr tony arklay and roger byrom; and &#8226; in asking the appellant to read the first respondent's complaint of sexual harassment against him, or by failing to dismiss the first respondent's complaint summarily without calling for his response, the conduct of the second respondent did not constitute sexual harassment of him.
1 this is an appeal from a decision of jarrett fm of 12 october 2005 ( gauci v kennedy [2005] fmca 1505) where his honour summarily dismissed a claim of mr gauci ("the appellant") for relief against the second respondent for a breach of pt ii div 3 sex discrimination act 1984 (cth) ("sd act").
