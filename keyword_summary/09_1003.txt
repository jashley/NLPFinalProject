the second complaint is the failure by the primary judge to grant mr nicholls an adjournment.
indeed, as i have already noted, at trial mr nicholls sought an adjournment of the application, which it may be inferred his honour thought was a further delay on mr nicholls' part.
the third complaint relates apparently to the cross-examination of mr nicholls during the application for the adjournment.
