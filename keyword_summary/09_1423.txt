accordingly on 15 july 2005, acma filed an amended statement of claim purporting to substitute acma as an applicant in the place of aca.
application is now made pursuant to o 6 r 10(2) of the federal court rules to formally ensure that acma replaces aca as the named applicant on the court record.
i have not considered closely the question of whether an order is absolutely necessary in the circumstances but what is clear is that the legislative effect of item 6 of sch 4 to the acma act provides in subs 1 that (subject to sub-item(2)), if any proceedings to which the australian broadcasting authority (aba) or the aca was a party were pending in any court or tribunal immediately before the transition time, acma is to be substituted for aba or aca from the transition time as a party to the proceedings.
