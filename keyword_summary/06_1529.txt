what use to happen that the hindu drug lords use to sell the drugs to many sikhs drug dealers to sell them, and purchase the arms, this was one way or the other was a typing mistake, and the word of pakistan came in, the drug was to be selled [sic] in pakistani punjab.
as the applicant has always claimed to be a citizen of india who was seeking a protection visa on the basis of his political opinion and membership of the akali dahl party, it is quite clear that the reference to pakistan and a struggle against the drug lords of that country has no relevance to the applicant's case at all.
the appellant's claims involved being a leader of the akali dal party (badal group) and having false charges laid against him by the congress party.
