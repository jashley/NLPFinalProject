they claim to have organised a rally or procession of children connected with the muslim calendar, this rally was attacked by the shiv sena and the first appellant's husband was injured.
acceptance that the injuries occurred in the course of the procession does not involve any acceptance of there being an attack during the procession as claimed.
in particular, they were in fear of persecution at the hands of a group called shiv sena which, it is accepted, is an extremist hindu group.
