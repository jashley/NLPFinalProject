there is nothing in the letters to indicate that the applicants had made such claims to mr sacsady, mr arounsavat or miss arounsavat.
ms arounsavat asserted that the applicants would face certain financial and social difficulties if they returned to laos.
the tribunal concludes that mr sacsady, mr arounsavat or miss arounsavat went beyond giving evidence about matters they had knowledge about and speculated about what they thought might happen to the applicants in laos .
