the respondent noted that proceedings are conducted less formally in the federal magistrates court and referred to the decision in kurniadi v loh (2002) 193 alr 253 ; [2002] fca 1021 at [21] in which carr j observed that appeals from the federal magistrates court were not automatically allocated to a full court but might be dealt with by a single judge (a trend carr j described in 2002 as one occurring with increased frequency).
the applicants did not know whether the proceedings are more likely to be heard and determined earlier and at less cost in the federal magistrates court and note the present quantum of their claim in the sum of $350,000 plus any amount from their entitlements to trailing commissions.
