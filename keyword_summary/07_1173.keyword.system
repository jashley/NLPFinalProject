the tribunal was satisfied the appellant was not a teacher in china, that he did not own a school in china and that he was not a falun gong practitioner in china.
the tribunal did not accept the appellant had been arrested or detained in china for practising falun gong.
the tribunal failed to assess the chance of my persecution on my return to china because of my involvement with falun gong.
