by an application filed on 2 march 2007, the respondent, les laboratoires servier ('servier') sought to amend australian patent no 2001276418.
in those circumstances, where half of the hearing time concerned those issues, servier submits that apotex's entitlement should be discounted by 50%.
servier submits that although the ultimate result was in apotex's favour and apotex is entitled to have costs of the hearing, it is appropriate to allow a discount in servier's favour to account for servier's success in relation to the allowability of the amendments under s 102.
