the focus is on anti-competitive effect rather than purpose.
(c) in specifying the kind of conduct said to be anti-competitive: (i) the notice does not articulate the substance of the anti-competitive conduct or how it is characterised to be anti-competitive; (ii) the explanation is circular and amounts to saying that the conduct is anti-competitive where it is anti-competitive.
while the notices relate to asserted anti-competitive conduct, these proceedings are not to determine whether telstra has engaged in anti-competitive conduct.
