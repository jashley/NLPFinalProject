i am also satisfied that, by reason of this default, i should dismiss the application for the extension of time.
in all of these circumstances, where the applicant has chosen not to attend the court, i am satisfied that the appropriate order is that the application be dismissed, and i so order.
accordingly, i further order the applicant to pay the first respondent's costs fixed in the amount of $1,550.
