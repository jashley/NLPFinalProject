associate: dated: 30 august 2007 counsel for the appellant: the applicant appeared in person counsel for the respondent: mr m mckenney solicitor for the respondent: felix a vitiello date of hearing: 27 august 2007 date of judgment: 27 august 2007 austlii: copyright policy | disclaimers | privacy policy | feedback url: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/fca/2007/1377.html
the applicant submitted that there was no argument to be put against the stay but as mr mckenney, who appeared for the respondents, submitted, the general principle is that an appeal does not operate as a stay unless a judge or a court otherwise orders.
in due course, presumably, jessup j will make an order as to costs.
