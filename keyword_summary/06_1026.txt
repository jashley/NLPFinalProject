the appellant also claimed persecution by the police for his religion as a muslim and his political opinion, and persecution by local hindu shopkeepers who were part of the hindu nationalist movement and who were jealous of the appellant's successful business.
on 12 november 2004 the appellant filed an amended application which alleged that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction and constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction by: failing to find that the appellant would be abducted by pakistani underground agents and the muslim league even if he relocated; that it failed to give valid reasons why relocation would be safe; failed to consider that the appellant was on a hit list; and failed to understand that the appellant did not face harassment from shopkeepers but from pakistani underground agents, the muslim league and indian authorities.
