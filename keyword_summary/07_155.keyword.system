the appellant claims she cannot return to china because of her well-founded fear of persecution as a falun gong practitioner.
she claims to have been a falun gong member since 1997 and that she participated in falun gong activities in beijing in 1999 when such participation was banned.
the tribunal found the appellant was unable to answer basic questions regarding falun gong and she did not know the relevant exercises involved in the practice of falun gong.
