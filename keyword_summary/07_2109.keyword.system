5 accordingly the decision of the repatriation commission under review is set aside and in lieu thereof i determine that the death of robert thomas butler was war caused and that the applicant, ruth isobel hall, is entitled to a war widow's pension as from 27 february 2005.
counsel for the repatriation commission submits that is not a step which ought to be taken and i have been referred to a series of authorities, culminating in repatriation commission v butcher [2007] fcafc 36 ; (2007) 94 ald 364, which stress the sparing nature of the potential use of the power granted by s 44 of the administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 (cth) generally, and in particular, by s 44(7).
