2 earlier i had found that by causing bgr to pay their legal costs associated with the proceedings, triad and cordato partners services had acted oppressively to food improvers (see order 3(a) made on 12 february 2007: the food improvers pty ltd v bgr corporation pty ltd (no 3) [2007] fca 97).
1 when preparing order 1 and my reasons for judgment given on 28 february 2007 ( the food improvers pty ltd v bgr corporation pty ltd (no 4) [2007] fca 220) , i overlooked that the plaintiffs had argued, as is shown in their written submissions dated 13 february 2007, that costs paid not just by bgr but the bgr group should be repaid by triad and cordato services partners.
i overlooked the plaintiffs' submissions that i should frame the relief more generally than just affecting bgr.
