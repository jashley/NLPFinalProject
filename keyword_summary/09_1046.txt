mr angeleri admitted that he controlled the tenth defendant's account into which the payments were made.
the sixth defendant was effectively controlled by the first defendant, mr denis angeleri, and mr angeleri has admitted in his defence that he controlled the sixth defendant's account into which payments were made in the course of a drawn-out series of fraudulent transactions.
it may readily be inferred that mr angeleri controlled the flow of funds from the second plaintiff's account to that of the sixth defendant and that he well knew that the sixth defendant was not entitled to the funds which had been transferred in the manner i have described.
