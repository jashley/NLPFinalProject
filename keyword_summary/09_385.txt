i am not criticising ms sagigi when i make that finding.
he found that ms sagigi was tender at the lumbrosacral level: she forward flexes to her shins but has to climb up slowly in the way of extension.
in summary, he had seen ms sagigi for a review and had taken the back history as i have previously described.
