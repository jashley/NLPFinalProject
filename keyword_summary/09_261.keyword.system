the applicants are presently in the course of a two-day hearing before lloyd-jones fm in which they seek orders that examination summonses issued to the bankrupt, mr terry donald hill, and to ms rose, mr o'neill and mr nicholas eddy be discharged.
the ground on which the application before the federal magistrate is made is that the trusteeship is being used to oppress mr hill and his wife as well as his lawyer, mr o'neill, and his former lawyer, mr eddy.
the undertaking which mr dubler is prepared to give is that he will not permit the cross-examination of mr hill to amount to a dress rehearsal of the examination summons.
