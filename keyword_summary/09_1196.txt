in permitting this material to be admitted: in my view the appropriate orders are as follows: the court will receive material from mr paul everett, mrs ann everett and mr andrew mccallum, being immediate family members of mr mark mccallum, which material will be confined to the impact of the demise of mr mark mccallum on their lives.
three of mr mccallum's relatives wish to table material by way of written statement, explaining the impact of the loss of mr mccallum on their lives.
