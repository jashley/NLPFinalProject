the commission refers to the fact that the veteran's nephrologist, dr johnson, rejected smoking as a cause of the veteran's glomerulonephritis and renal failure.
glomerulonephritis is a renal disease characterised by inflammation of the glomeruli, or small blood vessels in the kidneys.
the commission submits that no new hypothesis can be formulated to connect the veteran's death to his operational service through his glomerulonephritis and claimed ' war-caused ' smoking habit since smoking is not a cause of glomerulonephritis recognised by the gn sop.
