the scheme of arrangement provides for the merger of the plaintiff with another public company, bluestone tin limited ('bluestone'), which is to be accomplished by the transfer of all the shares in the plaintiff to bluestone, in consideration for the issue to the plaintiff's shareholders of five shares in bluestone for every one share in the plaintiff.
6 in my view, the plaintiff's argument does not provide any basis for departing from the decision of lindgren j in webcentral .
' 7 another reason for not departing from the approach of lindgren j in webcentral , is that in his reasons given when his honour made orders for the convening of meetings in respect of that scheme of arrangement ( webcentral group limited, in the matter of webcentral group limited [2006] fca 937 at [14] ), his honour referred to the fact that gyles j of this court, and barrett j of the new south wales supreme court, had also taken the same approach to the 'no encumbrances' clause.
