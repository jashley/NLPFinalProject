this is distinct from the references to ' first approval ' (s 70(5)(b)), ' market the substance, or a product containing the substance, in australia ' (s 70(6)(a)) and ' import into australia, for general marketing ' (s 70(6)(b)).
that is, the definition recognises approval to import or supply in australia outside entry in the artg.
the former encompasses goods which must be registered before they can be marketed in australia while the latter encompasses goods manufactured in australia for export only (sch 4, pt 1 of the tg regulations).
