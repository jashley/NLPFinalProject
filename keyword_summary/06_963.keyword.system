associate: dated: 11 august 2006 the applicant is self- represented.
the tribunal pointed out to the applicant that his passport would show that he had been in new zealand and australia and not in pakistan.
i should say in this case that the period of time that the applicant has been in australia - a period of over 16 years - is a matter of concern.
