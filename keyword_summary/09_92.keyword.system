the accepted fact was that the first wife finally moved out in december 2003 or january 2004.
the issue to be resolved is the relationship with the sponsor after relations with his former wife had ceased in december 2003.
on 20 december 2006 the appellant applied to the federal magistrate's court for relief against the tribunal's first decision, and on 4 may 2007 and by consent the federal magistrate's court set aside the tribunal's first decision.
