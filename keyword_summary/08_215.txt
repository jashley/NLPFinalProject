a privative clause decision is defined in s 474(2) of the migration act as ' a decision of an administrative character made...under this act...other than a decision referred to in subsection (4) or (5) '.
it follows that this decision of the tribunal is a privative clause decision or a purported privative clause decision and not a "non-privative clause decision" as defined in s 474(6) of the migration act .
an appeal to the federal court under section 44 is available in relation to a non-privative clause decision.
