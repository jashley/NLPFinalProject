she claims she and her mother were injured in 1998 when a car driven by an employee of the general secretary of the dhaka city awami league struck their rickshaw.
3 the appellant claimed to fear harm from both the awami league ('al') and the bangladesh national party ('bnp') because of her sister's marriage to a member of the jatiya party in 1986.
the tribunal is satisfied that this would have been sufficient motivation for a campaign of threats and intimidation against the family, including regular visits to the house to extort money, threats of acid throwing, the attack on the applicant and her mother in a rickshaw in 1998, the beating of the applicant's brother and the final forced eviction in september 2004.
