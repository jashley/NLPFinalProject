the correspondence from tan &amp; tan was carried out by people other than yat tan who should have acted for the applicant.
the application was lodged on 15 september 2006 by someone at the firm, tan &amp; tan lawyers &amp; consultants.
there appears to be fraudulent effort by staff at tan &amp; tan to give the impression that yat tan was to be and indeed was the migration agent.
