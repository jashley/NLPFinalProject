16 a deed of 24 june 1993 between cpl and 'the carringbush group' recites cpl's notice of intention to resign as trustee of the carringbush trust.
the appellants say the commissioner has not done so because the asfic at paragraph 5(3) of the contentions at page 24 of the asfic simply asserts: 'alternatively, the acts, transactions and events, related above, that occurred on or about 8 september 1998 constituted a resettlement of [the carringbush trust]'.
