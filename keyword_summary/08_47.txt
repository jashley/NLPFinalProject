this premise may be distilled, in particular, from the judgment in thomas borthwick and sons (pacific holdings) ltd v trade practices commission (1988) 18 fcr 424 ( 'thomas borthwick' ).
however, kristoffersen v department of employment, workplace relations and small business [2002] fcafc 269 ( 'kristoffersen' ) held that an applicant for leave to appeal had no right to require its application to be dealt with by a full court.
10 kristoffersen and many other cases accepted the premise that there was no appeal from the exercise of a discretion by a single judge refusing leave to appeal.
