accordingly, i reject this basis of jarra creek's application.
other orders relating to the form of opt out notice proposed by jarra creek and general directions were made on the day of the hearing.
accordingly, in this case, i do not think that an order should be made in the unqualified terms sought by jarra creek at this stage.
