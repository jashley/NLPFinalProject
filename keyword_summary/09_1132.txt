that broadcast occurred with the permission and licence of tvbo.
the co-production agreement between tvb and tvbo dated 8 january 2003 was tendered in evidence before me.
the only licences granted by tvbo in respect of broadcast rights in australia are those which were granted to tvb australia and tvbi.
