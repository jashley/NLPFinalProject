one of those orders is that the githabul nation aboriginal corporation is to hold the native title rights and interests as agent for the githabul people who are the common law holders (s 56 and s 57(2) and (3)).

it reflects great credit on the githabul people and particularly the named applicant mr trevor close, the state of new south wales, ntscorp limited and the casino rural lands protection board.
