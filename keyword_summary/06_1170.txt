the application was made by mr mark clisby, solicitor for the appellant.
on 1 february 2004, mr clisby filed a notice of discontinuance of the proceedings.
although mr clisby does not name the migration agent, it appears that by this time the appellant's migration agent was a mr fahmi hussain since the documents signed by the appellant which were attached to the affidavit of mr clisby were countersigned by mr hussain.
