i have also noted the discussion of shackley and andrews in marshall j's judgment in konrad v victoria police (1998) 78 ir 54 at 56-57.
18 in support of a narrow construction of s 824(2), the respondents referred me to several authorities that had considered the former provisions of s 170eha, which effectively continued as s 170cs (now s 666 of the wra): see thomas v school of mines services pty ltd (unreported, industrial relations court of australia, farrell jr, 5 august 1996); turner v composite buyers ltd (unreported, industrial relations court of australia, millane jr, 28 january 1997) and fenech v perfect health medical centres pty ltd (unreported, industrial relations court of australia, ryan jr, 12 june 1998) (' fenech' ).
in fact, in fenech , ryan jr referred to an earlier order made by marshall j in the proceedings, to the effect that the respondent should pay costs pursuant to s 170eha as a result of the dismissal of its application for an interlocutory injunction.
