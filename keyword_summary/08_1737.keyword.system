in doing so his honour referred to the letter just mentioned from mr hosking and a further email that the court had received stating that we want to formally withdraw from this appeal.
the next day mr hosking forwarded to the solicitors for black &amp; decker and also to the registrar of the federal court a letter stating, amongst other things, that gmca wished to "withdraw very shortly" from the appeal and that it did not intend to instruct its solicitors in light of "the extraordinary financial circumstances of the company".
on 18 april 2008 i gave judgment in their favour on liability issues and on 19 june 2008, amongst other things, i ordered that the respondent gmca pay black &amp; decker's costs of the claim and cross-claim, including reserved costs, such costs to be taxed as between party and party except for some items on an indemnity basis.
