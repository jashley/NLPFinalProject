this demonstrated the appellant's lack of dedication, commitment and ongoing interest in falun gong.
ground 6 thereof stated: 'the tribunal questioned about the genuiness of my being a falungong member because i had expressed to him that "falun gong" is religion, and the tribunal referred to the wrong independent information, believing that "falun gong" is not religion, the tribunal therefore questioned about my credibility and began to have bias against me.
