the proceedings which are pending in azerbaijan are now confined only to requiring the respondent to produce documents.
the alleged breaches of ss 180, 181, 182 and 183 of the act are said to have occurred in foreign countries, namely, azerbaijan and kazakhstan.
in my view, those observations are apt and apply in these circumstances, because the relief which is sought in this proceeding is, on the evidence, not available in the azerbaijan proceedings - the azerbaijan court having declined to adjudicate upon the causes of action the subject of this proceeding.
