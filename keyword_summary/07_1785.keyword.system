27 for the reasons given above, i do not propose to make any orders against mr fisher.
i do not consider that mr fisher's own conduct has been demonstrated to be so unreasonable, or even that if the application against saxbys was obviously without merit, that a costs order against mr fisher would be appropriate.
15 for the reasons given above in relation to the submission of the plaintiffs that mr fisher should pay costs, i reject the similar contention put on behalf of t &amp; g welding.
