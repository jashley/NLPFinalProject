the appellant asserted that in 2005 the sunnis abducted him, but that he managed to escape and continued hiding until he left pakistan.
the tribunal failed to carry out its review function and exercise its jurisdiction in that: &#8226; it did not consider the immense and intimidating pressure on the appellant by sunnis because of his shi'a background &#8226; it did not consider the appellant's claim that sunnis would kill him if he returned to pakistan.
after they were released, the appellant claimed that they continued threatening him whereby he left his village but the sunnis followed him and continued threatening him.
