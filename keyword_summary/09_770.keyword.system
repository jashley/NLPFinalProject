in the event, following further exploration of the issues with counsel, i do not believe it can be said that the evidence of mr honey is irrelevant and unlikely to be helpful.
counsel for the applicant strongly presses the view that some of the fees of the applicant's experts seem excessive and in any event, that the expert evidence of a chartered accountant, mr barry honey, should be considered unnecessary.
