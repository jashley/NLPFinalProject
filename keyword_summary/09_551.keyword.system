from the statement of claim and the annexures thereto, the applicant, the australian competition and consumer commission (the accc) makes the following allegations: 5.1.
applying the general steel test, in my judgment the contentions by the accc that the documents convey the alleged representations are at least arguable, with the consequence that those impugned paragraphs should not be struck out.
the respondents attack paragraphs of the statement of claim which relate to the representations which the accc alleges are made by the sending out of the lan documents and by the notice of intention document, which are annexed to the statement of claim.
