such an approach was adopted, for example, in mzwik v minister of immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2005] fca 185 and voaq v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs (2005) 224 alr 460.
in reaching this conclusion, i have considered the principles in other cases dealing with similar matters, in particular the decisions of nakx v minister of immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2003] fca 1559 , and nalm v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2004] fcafc 17 , which support the exercise of the power in these circumstances.
