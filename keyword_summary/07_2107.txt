the evidence before me is that it was an estonian passport in the name of juri moskov.
in addition, there was evidence in the material provided by finland, in support of its request for extradition, that mr tervonen had made admissions that he had passports from several countries in another name, namely urmas murk, including one issued by estonia.
12 a passport was found in mr tervonen's possession when he was arrested.
