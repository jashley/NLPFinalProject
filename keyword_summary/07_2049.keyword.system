administrative appeals tribunal did not have not [sic] enough information to make their deliberation; c. the applicant made every effort to seek the respondent to prove their case and to bring witnesses: applicant "witnesses on behalf of centerlink [sic] " mr de uray "i have no idea what witnesses mr pham is alluding to" d. mr de uray conspired to pervert justice by fabricating documents and relabelling them and their dates; 10 to some extent, it has been necessary for me to seek information from the solicitor acting for the respondent to make sense of the material in the notice of appeal.
that commences with the words: take notice that the applicant appeals from the decision or determination of ( administraive [sic] appeals tribunal ) constituted by ( mr jr handley, senior member ) given on ( 15 october 2007 ) at ( melbourne ) by which the tribunal decided or determined ( adjournment of hearing and vexatious and frivolous and selective and racial discrimination ).
