' 4 the applicants in this case have submitted that the case of baird &amp; ors v state of queensland (no 377 of 2005), which is currently on appeal to the full federal court, is an application involving an almost identical application to the present except that it involved aboriginal persons who had worked at the hope vale and wujal wujal reserves between 1975 and 1986.
6 clear possible alternatives are that the hearing proceed, but judgment in this matter be reserved until the baird appeal decision has been delivered, and/or the parties be given leave to make additional submissions after the hearing and in light of principles which may emerge from the baird appeal.
