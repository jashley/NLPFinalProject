mr hahnheuser was the one who gave the television interviews.
at least two other persons were present with mr hahnheuser in the feedlot, one operating the video camera and one shown in the video walking with mr hahnheuser, wearing a tee-shirt similar to that worn by mr hahnheuser.
further, there is no evidence that mr hahnheuser interfered directly with the sheep.
