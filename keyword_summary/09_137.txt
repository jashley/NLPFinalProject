first, valuation evidence in relation to the cadetta tenements.
at the time of the cadetta deal: (a) the value of the cadetta shares was completely disproportionate to the value of the chameleon shares and the chameleon options offered by chameleon in exchange for those cadetta shares under chameleon's bidder's statement for cadetta as pleaded in paragraph 78 above, and at all events the value of the cadetta tenements in may 2004 was no more than approximately $274,000; (b) in the alternative, if cadetta was not the owner of the cadetta tenements in may 2004, the cadetta shares which chameleon offered to purchase under chameleon's bidder's statement for cadetta were worthless.
firstly, that the cadetta tenements were worthless and secondly, in the alternative, that the cadetta tenements were worth no more than approximately $274,000.
