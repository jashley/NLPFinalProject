based on the highly conflicting and contradictory evidence before me in relation to the applicant's problems with members of partia shjiptar atdheu i find that the applicant was not a witness of truth in this regard and that his evidence in relation to his problems with partia shjiptar atdheu lacks credibility.
in an incident on 3 july 2005 he publicly expressed his opposition to the islamic muslim party ("partia shquiptare atgheu").
[the appellant] informs us that since his departure from albania members of the partia shquiptare atgheu have attended at his parent's [sic] address looking for him.
