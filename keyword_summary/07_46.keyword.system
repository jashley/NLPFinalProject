24 i find mr russo's explanation of this letter unconvincing.
in april 2004 the respondent left australia for scotland.
according to mr russo, the respondent telephoned him whilst he was driving to the city and asked mr russo to draft a letter saying that the respondent lived in sutton forest in 2003 when he negotiated mr chidgzey's contract.
