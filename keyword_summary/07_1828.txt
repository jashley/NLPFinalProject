in the course of my roles with gambro australia, first as technical sales representative, then as sales &amp; marketing manager and later as managing director, i have had a very large number of discussions with customers of gambro australia, as well as those in the market for hd machines, hd consumables, additional hd products and hd services, about the relative advantages and disadvantages of hd machines, hd consumables, additional hd products and hd services available in the australian market.
