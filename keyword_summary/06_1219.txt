austal seeks preliminary discovery orders against messrs merrigan and thurlow and members of the incat group of companies.
it extended to documents evidencing communications by or from incat during a period called 'the relevant period' and involving a reference, directly or indirectly, to: the thurlow email; the austal report; the austal 126 trimaran; and any comparison between the austal 126 trimaran with an austal 101 catamaran and/or incat catamaran.
mr thurlow used the austal report in his email as a basis for making disparaging remarks about the austal trimaran.
