i also accept that i departed nepal in august 2005.
articles in nepalese news sources report that nepalese 'leaving their villages need letters from authorities [in nepal] to prove to nepali and indian police that they are not maoists'.
i had been unable to depart nepal as soon as i obtained my passport because i did not have visa and other means to depart nepal.
