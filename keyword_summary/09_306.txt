the tribunal accepted that the appellant husband had been a member of the aissf since 1984 or 1985.
this finding was in part because the appellant had had only limited political involvement and profile with the aissf.
although the appellant husband claimed to have had telephone contact with the aissf during the time that he had been in australia, he had not been politically active, nor had he supported the aissf financially or in any other way.
