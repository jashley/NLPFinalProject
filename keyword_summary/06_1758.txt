the minister submitted that his decision to cancel the applicant's visa did not conflict with the cssp and there was no matter concerning the cssp about which the applicant could have relevantly been heard.
the minister submitted that even if the court were to find that the applicant was stateless the applicant could not have had a legitimate expectation that the minister would consider obligations arising under the cssp because the cssp was not one of the international instruments expressly referred to in direction 21.
the minister contended that if there were any obligations flowing from the cssp they would attach to a removal decision, rather than a cancellation decision.
