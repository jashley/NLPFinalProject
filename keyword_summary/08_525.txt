9 i am also satisfied that there is a prima facie case made by the sierra leone company, kariba.
it is kariba kono (sl) limited (kariba), a company which is incorporated in sierra leone, and is the company which actually carries out the tailings operations in sierra leone to which i referred in my earlier reasons in this case ( mineral commodities ltd v promet engineers africa (pty) ltd [2008] fca 30).
accordingly, i am satisfied that there is a prima facie case, in the sense necessary for service out of the jurisdiction in relation to the claim made by kariba.
