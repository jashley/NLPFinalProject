in my view, the fixing of a gross sum for costs in the sum of $12,832.75 is "logical, fair and reasonable": see ginos engineers pty ltd v autodesk australia pty ltd (2008) 249 alr 871 , at [25].
the power to order gross sum of costs is one which has to be exercised judicially, and after giving the parties adequate opportunity to make submissions on the matter: auspine ltd v australian newsprint mills ltd [1999] fca 673 ; (1999) 93 fcr 1 ; ualesi (t/a australian empire imports) v expeditors international pty ltd [2006] fca 26.
one factor which i regard as significant in exercising the discretion to make an order for gross sum of costs, in the circumstances of the present case, is that, having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant, the additional cost for taxation is likely to impose a significant burden on the respondent, without real prospects of recovering those additional costs: sparnon v apand pty ltd [1998] fca 164 ; sony entertainment (australia) ltd v smith [2005] fca 228 ; (2005) 215 alr 788.
