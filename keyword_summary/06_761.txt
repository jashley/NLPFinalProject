his honour did not find it necessary to consider whether issue estoppel applied: see mzwkj v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fmca 1294 (" mzwkj ") at [28].
sundberg j reached the same conclusion in relation to much the same submission in mzwgj v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fca 1501 (" mzwgj "), when he rejected a similar submission that anshun estoppel did not apply in a subsequent judicial review proceeding because of the different focus of the muin and lie litigation.
as sundberg j said in mzwgj at [11], the lack of legal representation cannot of itself amount to special circumstances sufficient to warrant the court declining to apply anshun estoppel.
