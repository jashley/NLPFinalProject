neither mr nicholls, the departmental officer who made the decision that a nsw prisons official should be requested to take mr soh into custody, nor ms symons, the officer who implemented that decision, afforded mr soh procedural fairness before ms symons made the request.
mr furlong, the operations manager of villawood who recommended to departmental officers that mr soh be transferred to silverwater, committed the tort of misfeasance in a public office.
within a couple of months, mr soh had the repeated opportunity to say why thenceforth he should not be imprisoned.
