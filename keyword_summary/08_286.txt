in the process the high court said that it was not necessary to consider whether the views expressed in tampion and licul were consistent.
the latter case was the kind discussed in tampion and re luck, but, as the judgment in anshun [no 1] makes clear, tampion and therefore re luck do not concern the former kind of case, with which we are concerned here.
the court therefore concluded (at [9]) that: given the long established english rule, the decision in tampion and our decisions in pye, hall, carr and bienstein, we see no valid reason for departing from the rule laid down in tampion.
