of substance, though, is that dr mallen-cooper's statement was provided in early august, well prior to the time when dr kind and mr tait came to confer in accordance with the pre-trail direction.
in other words, such procedural fairness aspects as might attend the reception of those parts of dr mallen-cooper's affidavit that relate to more than just past events have, in my opinion, been observed.
further, and also of substance, is the fact that it is apparent that mr tait was, prior to that expert conference, and certainly prior to his giving evidence, seized with, in full, dr mallen-cooper's statement.
