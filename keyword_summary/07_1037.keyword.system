as i made clear during the 13 june 2007 hearing, and as i specifically indicated in my judgment, i was not prepared to adjourn the hearing for want of appearance.
2 although i am considering an application filed by the appellant in the substantive matter, for convenience i shall continue to refer to szhje as "the appellant".
however, i am not persuaded that there is any reason to depart from my decision in szhje [2007] fca 904.
