i can see no error in the federal magistrate's approach.
nor can i see any problem with the federal magistrate's conclusion that the tribunal's approach revealed no jurisdictional error.
as to the fourth ground, i agree with the federal magistrate's conclusion at [45] that it was pertinent for the tribunal to take into account that the fact that the appellant's brother, who was said to have been a member of a sikh political party, had remained in india and had not been ill-treated.
