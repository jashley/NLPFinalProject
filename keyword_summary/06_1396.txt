it is not in issue that s 1217 limits the portability period of the appellant's pension payment to 13 weeks.
the table relevantly provides that the maximum portability period for a person in receipt of disability support pension is 13 weeks.
the tribunal takes the view that mr rajcinoski's telephone contact with centrelink on 19 april 2004, in which he queried the portability arrangements, was in response to that letter.
