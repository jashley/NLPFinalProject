i do not consider this case assists the plaintiff.
16 reliance was also placed by the plaintiff upon the authority of young j in collingridge v sontor pty ltd (1997) 141 flr 440, particularly the passage at 445.
but, in any event, even if i am wrong as to this analysis, in my view the decision of young j does not deal with the point i need to decide, namely whether there is a requirement for a special resolution in this case.
