a similar submission was put forward in respect of the weight given to the evidence comprising the special rapporteur's report.
the appellant accepted that the tribunal did not have to make separate findings on each piece of evidence which was placed before it but he submitted that although it was open to the tribunal to prefer the united states state department report on religious freedom over the special rapporteur's report, the tribunal should have set out why it preferred that report over the special rapporteur's report.
at the hearing of the appeal the appellant submitted that the tribunal had failed in its statutory task to assess the appellant's claim that he feared persecution because he had converted to christianity from islam and that it had failed to assess that claim by reference to the evidence before it, comprising letters from ostensibly reputable religious organisations in nigeria and australia, the united nations special rapporteur's report on freedom of religion or belief: mission to nigeria --- 7 october 2005 ("the special rapporteur's report") and the psychological assessment of the appellant dated 15 october 2007.
