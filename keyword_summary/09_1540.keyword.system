mr evans submitted further that there is, in substance or in truth, as he put it, no meaningful distinction between the defence pursuant to s 1317s of the act upon which mr carroll has succeeded, and the defences pursuant to s 588h of the act on which he failed.
i found that the defendant had contravened s 588g(2) of the act, and so i concluded that i should make a declaration accordingly.
