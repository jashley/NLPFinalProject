she broke off the engagement thus giving rise to a blood feud between her family and that of her ex-fianc&eacute;.
i interpolate that at the time of the tribunal hearing with which this appeal is concerned, the appellants' claim was broadened to include claims that the husband's sister had been raped by her ex-fianc&eacute; and that the family had difficulty in dealing with corrupt officials in albania in relation to land owned by them.
the questions and comments summarised above disclose that the tribunal member found it hard to accept that an albanian who feared harm from her ex-fianc&eacute;, and perhaps his family, could live in safety in an area largely populated by albanians only five kilometres from her home village.
