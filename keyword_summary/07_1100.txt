the appellant alleged that persecution began during the last election campaign when he was threatened and attacked because he was campaigning for the cdpu candidate and against president kuchma.
in his initial application for a protection visa the appellant claimed to have been a member of the christian-democratic party of ukraine ('the cdpu') since 1997 and that he had actively participated in the political life in the city of ternopil.
10 the tribunal made findings that the appellant's claimed fear of harm from those who were convicted of stealing the appellant's horses would not constitute fear for a convention reason; that the secret service would not harm the appellant in the future because of any past involvement in the cdpu; that the appellant was never a member of the cdpu; and that the change in political circumstances in the ukraine was such that the appellant's claims did not, in any event, give rise to a well founded fear of persecution.
