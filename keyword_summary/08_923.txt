i wish to appeal judge hartnett's ruling.
one of the handwritten completions is to describe the respondent as "b.h.p north altona melb".
in that affidavit he says as follows: the nature of the case is that i was groped on the genitals by a co-worker while working at b.h.p north altona in april 1995.
