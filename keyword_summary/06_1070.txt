the appellant stated that he had tried relocating from parbat to kathmandu but still could not escape the maoists, and he claimed that should he migrate to india, the maoists would pursue him there as well.
the appellant's claims in relation to the situation in parbat, supported by the documents, were not rejected by the tribunal.
the tribunal found the appellant's claims regarding matters after his relocation to kathmandu were 'far-fetched' and did not accept that the profile of the appellant, which was local to parbat, was such that would lead maoists to pursue him to kathmandu in order to harm him.
