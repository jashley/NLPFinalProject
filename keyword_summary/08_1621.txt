mr sobey's solicitors filed further affidavits from mr sobey and mr lipson on 3 and 4 september 2008 respectively.
on that day too, mr sobey filed and served his outline of submissions, in which counsel for mr sobey stated that mr sobey "will also seek to rely on further affidavits from sobey and lipson; and oral evidence from subpoenaed witnesses".
mr sobey has given no adequate explanation for this failure.
