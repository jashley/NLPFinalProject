wtt carries on business providing taxi-cab network services.
hence each owner of each shepparton taxi-cab became a member of wtt.
the directors procured each operator to agree to operate his taxi-cab or cause his taxi-cab to be operated during the shifts allotted to their taxi-cab in the roster (roster-on provision) and would not operate his taxi-cab and cause their taxi-cab not to be operated during other times (roster-off provision).
