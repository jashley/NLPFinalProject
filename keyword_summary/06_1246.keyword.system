4 on 22 june 2006, i granted pan an anti-anti-suit injunction for reasons which i then gave.
there is, however, no evidence whatever before me, that apart from the inference i am asked to make apart, pan would dissipate its assets.
comandate marine did not suggest, nor did pan, that either order had been engaged to benefit comandate marine at the present time by obtaining or affecting assets of pan's as security.
