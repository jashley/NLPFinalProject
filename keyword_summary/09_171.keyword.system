clearly, in my opinion, mr baljas does not meet the alone test set out in s 24 of the act.
the tribunal found that the relevant remunerative work which the applicant was undertaking was that of an air-conditioning plumber or installer.
its conclusion was expressed at [47]: because mr baljas suffered an injury to his shoulders which was not related to his service with the army, and that injury plays a part in preventing mr baljas from continuing to undertake the remunerative work that he was previously undertaking, it is nevertheless sufficient to preclude him from satisfying the alone test.
