the respondents submitted that the proceeding involved six actions (haviv against hsw, haviv against plaza, haviv against mr spence, mr aghion against hsw, mr aghion against plaza, and mr aghion against mr spence).
hence, haviv failed against two respondents (plaza and mr spence) and mr aghion failed against all three respondents.
mr blake's evidence was necessary because of this issue.
