that is simply not the case: jefferson ford at [71] per rares j, [191] per gordon j; ss 24(1) &amp; (1a) federal court act.
that is the case whether or not it is mandatory ( jefferson ford at [128]---[129] per gordon j) or discretionary ( j f keir v sparks [2008] fca 611 at [12] per graham j) to give summary judgment once that assessment is made or whether the discretion is a general one ( boston commercial at [45] per rares j) or limited by the circumstances of "no reasonable prospect of success" ( jefferson ford at [129] per gordon j).
the substantive proceedings concern commonwealth laws.
