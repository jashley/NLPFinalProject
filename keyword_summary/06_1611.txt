on 23 january 2006, another offer of compromise was sent raising the offer of salvage reward to $1,350,000.00.
however, i consider that the evidence as to veering, manoeuvring and similar dangers on which the plaintiffs relied was thoroughly canvassed in the hearing, and i accepted the submissions of the plaintiffs on this point as to the nature and extent of these problems.
