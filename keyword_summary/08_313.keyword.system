9 on or before 4 april 2008 the respondents should file and serve short answering submissions and on or before 11 april 2008 the applicant is to file and serve any reply.
i will direct that the respondents file and serve revised annexures a and b to the notice of motion on or before 4 april 2008.
i, as presently advised, see no impediment to those issues being raised by way of cross-claim and as a result of discussions in the course of the hearing this morning it is clear that counsel will not be in a position to file amended versions of the proposed pleadings before 4 april 2008.
