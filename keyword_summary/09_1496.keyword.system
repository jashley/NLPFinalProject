each application was adjourned to 14 december 2009 to enable the parties to make further submissions as to the form of orders to be made including orders as to costs, in light of the reasons for judgment.
the objection decision of the respondent dated 27 october 2006 is varied by setting aside the disallowance of the applicant's objection to the respondent's amended assessment the subject of para 1 of the application filed on 15 december 2006 and substituting for that decision, a decision allowing the objection of the applicant.
