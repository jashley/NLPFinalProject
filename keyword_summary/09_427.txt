in re locm pty ltd (administrators appointed) (1997) 79 fcr 35 , goldberg j came to the view that the court has power under section 447a to make an order extending the time fixed by section 439b(2).
shortly before the meeting of 20 april, mr chamberlain was contacted by a well-known businessman in wagga, who advised that he and three other well-known wagga businessmen were going to put forward a proposal for the club which would involve a deed of company arrangement in a form which was proposed to mr chamberlain at that time.
it may be argued that this period is a significant extension of the period of 45 business days from the date of the meeting prescribed by s 439b(2) , but even if that is so, it is my view that the authorities to which goldberg j referred in re locm are wide enough to permit the order which is sought.
