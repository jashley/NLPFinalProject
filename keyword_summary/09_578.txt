failure to consider unhrc provisions this proposed ground presents a number of difficulties.
(a) his honour failed to find that tribunal did not consider unhrc section 4,5,8,9,10 and did not consider at all cruelty against the humanity and therefore made error of law and jurisdictional error.
the tribunal noted that it would explain to him the importance of that information and seek his comment/response.
