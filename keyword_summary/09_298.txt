in this case objection was taken on behalf of mr and mrs cassimatis to the admission of exhibits mrr1 and mrr2 to mr ryan's affidavit.
in the result, i did not understand asic to press the tender of exhibits mrr1 and mrr2 beyond evidencing the fact of numerous investor complaints and their nature.
contrary to the submission made on behalf of mr and mrs cassimatis, it is not correct to state that neither exhibit mrr1 nor exhibit mrr2 feature in the reasons for judgement in respect of asic's substantive application.
