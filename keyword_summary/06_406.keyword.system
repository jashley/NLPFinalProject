associate: dated: 11 april 2006 first appellant represented the appellants in person counsel for the respondent: mr t reilly solicitor for the respondent: phillips fox date of hearing: 30 march 2006 date of judgment: 11 april 2006 austlii: copyright policy | disclaimers | privacy policy | feedback url: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/fca/2006/406.html
further, as mr reilly submits, the choice of assessment of country information is of course a factual matter for the tribunal alone: nahi v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs [2004] fcafc 10 at [11] - [13] .
nevertheless, i think that i should place on record that the appellants presented to the court as pleasant and commendable people.
