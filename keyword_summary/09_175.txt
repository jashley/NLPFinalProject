reliance was placed upon szkgf v minister for immigration and citizenship [2008] fcafc 84 and sziqb v minister for immigration and citizenship [2008] fcafc 20.
reservation is also presently expressed as to whether the present case is in any way analogous to the facts before the full court in szkgf .
the delay of over seven years in sziqb , and the other conduct of the claimant in that case, also seem far removed from the present case.
