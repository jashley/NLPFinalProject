the tribunal found that the appellant was never a member of the pkk, was never suspected or accused of being a member of the pkk, never distributed any pkk material, never suffered any resulting persecution and was not assisted by the pkk to leave turkey.
after the adjournment, the appellant told the tribunal that he had distributed books and brochures about the pkk.
11 the tribunal found that the appellant's evidence in relation to his alleged involvement in the pkk lacked credibility because he did not raise the matter of distribution of pkk material until after he had conferred with his wife and was unable to provide comment when the credibility of his claims was questioned.
