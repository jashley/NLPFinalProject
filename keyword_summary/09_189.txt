on the one hand, gni, when trading as gni finance corporation, was said to carry on a business of finance origination.
hence, so the submission went, as gni finance corporation was nothing more than a name under which gni carried on business, rather than the name of a separate legal entity, there was but one business which could be carried on by gni.
[sic] the tribunal accepted the position factually propounded by the appellant in his visa application, ie that gni operated two discrete businesses, one under the name gni finance corporation.
