this is a proud day for the kowanyama people.
the kowanyama dogit land (excluding the kowanyama township within the dogit) is that part of the determination area where exclusive native title rights and interests are to be recognised by the determination.
the coastal section is adjacent to the kowanyama dogit land, rutland plains pastoral lease and the inkerman pastoral lease.
