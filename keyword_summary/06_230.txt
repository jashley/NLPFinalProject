6 in the instant case the proposed arrangement to be put to the members for acceptance was that the whole of the shareholding in the plaintiff be acquired by iamgold corporation ("iamgold") and that the plaintiff become a wholly owned subsidiary of iamgold.
13 having regard to the fact that the members of the plaintiff were sufficiently informed by the explanatory statement to be able to determine for themselves whether it was in their interests for iamgold to acquire their shares, and did so in overwhelming numbers, and having regard to the fact that all requirements of the act have been met, i am satisfied that the court should approve the arrangement pursuant to s 411(6) of the act.
in the absence of any relevant evidence, and on the assumption that asic has given due consideration to the question and has not elicited any material relevant to the purpose of the proposal that should be put before the court, the court may be satisfied that the purpose of iamgold in participating in the proposed arrangement was to implement a merger with the plaintiff in the most efficient way and not to avoid the provisions of ch 6.
