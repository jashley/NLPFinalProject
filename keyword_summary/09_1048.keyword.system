castleworld contends that s 9 ba has the effect that the provisions of s 120 ba which render void as against a trustee in bankruptcy certain transactions, do not affect the indefeasibility regime of the tla as this statutory regime is not dealt with expressly or by necessary implication in the ba.
castleworld contends that the only issue is whether s 9 ba itself intends to leave operable the indefeasibility provisions of the tla.
further, the argument assumes that in all respects the good faith issues under the ba will be identical to the good faith issues under the tla.
