mr el-hanamia then made the submissions referred to below.
reasoning on appeal 16 when the matter came on for hearing before me on 15 february 2006, mr el-hanamia sought an adjournment for six further weeks.
however, because the applicant is in detention and due to other matters raised in relation to the chronology by mr markus for the respondent, combined with the fact that it was made clear to mr el-hanamia on 10 june february 2006 that the matter would be heard on 15 february 2006, i refused the application for adjournment.
