the bans, although invited by incompetent and bizarre management, were nonetheless illegal bans.
there appeared to be a ban, in name only, with respect to earthworks, as the organisers appear not to have been aware that crushtec came back on site on the afternoon of 21 october 2005.
there is similar previous conduct, most relevantly in stuart-mahoney .
