the motion is opposed and affidavits have been filed --- one by mr parker, supporting the motion; the other by max bratton, tidswell's mortgage manager, favouring the status quo.
12 otherwise mr bratton relies upon (i) adelaide being tidswell's place of business; (ii) the four witnesses --- two lay (himself and the company's managing director) and two expert --- all reside in south australia; (iii) for him and the managing director to go to brisbane for two weeks would cause significant disruption to the day-to-day management of tidswell's business; and (iv) tidswell's documentation is all in adelaide.
that exceptional matter, to which i earlier referred, is that tidswell's investment was solicited by the respondent mr benson who sought out mr bratton in south australia with the consequence that the causes of action advanced arose in that state.
