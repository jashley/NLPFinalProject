this is an appeal against an order of the federal magistrates court on 3 october 2008 dismissing the appellant's application for judicial review in connection with refusal of a protection (class xa) visa under s 65 of the migration act 1958 (cth) ( szlmk v minister for immigration &amp; anor [2008] fmca 1372).
in relation to the ground that the tribunal acted illogically by concluding the appellant was unreliable, the primary judge found that: - (i) illogicality in and of itself does not constitute jurisdictional error ( nacb v minister for immigration [2003] fcafc 235 at [22] - [29] ; natc v minister for immigration [2004] fcafc 52 at [25] - [27] ), (ii) the tribunal clearly considered the appellant's claims and disbelieved or gave no weight to them, (iii) the appellant was attempting to engage in impermissible merits review, and (iv) there was no basis to the claim that there was any legal error by reason of irrationality or illogicality in the tribunal's findings ( re minister for immigration &amp; multicultural affairs; ex parte applicant s20/2002 [2003] hca 30 ; (2003) 198 alr 59 at [9] ).
