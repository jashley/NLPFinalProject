he referred in support of this argument to these observations of heerey j in vqan v minister for immigration and multicultural and ethnic affairs [2003] fca 1541 (19 december 2003); '21 goldberg j [in m162 of 2002 v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2003] fca 1146] did not proceed on the basis that delay could be the sole consideration in exercising the discretion to refuse relief.
so much is apparent from the full court's citing, with approval, observations to that effect by heerey j in vqan v minister for immigration and multicultural and ethnic affairs [2003] fca 1541.
a delay of more than a year should ordinarily lead to relief being refused in the exercise of the court's discretion (see re commonwealth of australia: ex parte marks [2000] hca 67 ; (2000) 177 alr 491 per mchugh j at 495-6).
