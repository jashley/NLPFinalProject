2 the following undertaking has been offered by counsel for the first and second respondents, mr horak: the first respondent and second respondent, whether by itself, its officers, employees or agents or otherwise howsoever permanently undertake that they will cease and forever refrain from importing, distributing, offering for sale, selling or otherwise dealing in the course of trade in any goods to which australian trade mark no.
5 mr horak, on behalf of the respondents in the proceeding, has emphasised that there are public policy reasons why those orders ought not to be extended consistent with the formulation of the federal court practice note number 24, dealing with anton piller orders, which suggests that any period during which the respondent is to be restrained from informing any other person of the existence of the search order should be as short as possible and not extend beyond 4.30 pm on the return date of the order.
