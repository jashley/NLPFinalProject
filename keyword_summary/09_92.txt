the fact of the ivf program and the effort and expense involved is not diminished simply by an assertion that some people want to have children together outside of marriage.
it is not insignificant that the tribunal also seeks to diminish the weight of the ivf evidence by asserting that 'it is not rare for two people to deliberately have a child without an intention to be spouses.
one important consideration, by way of example, which very strongly supported the appellant's case was the fact that the sponsor and the appellant had participated in an expensive, difficult and time-consuming ivf program and incurred very substantial debts arising to over $10,000 as a consequence.
