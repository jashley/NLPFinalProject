more specifically, the accc seeks injunctions to restrain storesonline from committing further breaches.
18 in this case, breaches of certain terms of the undertaking given by storesonline are conceded.
while the breaches of the undertaking by storesonline do not warrant a blanket order restraining storesonline from making any presentations in australia, i am persuaded that the most appropriate course is to make orders requiring storesonline to give effect to the undertaking to which it made a commitment on 24 april 2006, until further order.
