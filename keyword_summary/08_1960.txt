2 the principal claims in the amended notice of appeal filed 26 september 2008 are that the primary judge erred in finding that: - (i) the use of terry fitzgerald's name and image on the yellow 33 south t-shirt conveyed a representation that there was an association between terry fitzgerald and the production and offering of the t-shirt, and (ii) a reasonable consumer in the relevant class would assume that mr fitzgerald had sanctioned, permitted or allowed the production and sale of the impugned t-shirt.
1 these proceedings involve an appeal against a decision of the federal magistrates court that the appellants pay damages of $26,000 for breach of the trade practices act 1974 (cth) and costs, as well as associated orders for delivery up of items associated with the sale of a t-shirt known as the yellow 33 south t-shirt.
3 the primary judge found (amongst other things) that: - (i) the relevant class of consumer was purchasers of surfboards and surf related products, (ii) amongst this group mr fitzgerald is well known as is his association with hot buttered international pty limited, (iii) with reference to all of the evidence, the use of mr fitzgerald's name and image on the yellow 33 south t-shirt was conduct misrepresenting to a reasonable member of the relevant class that mr fitzgerald had some association with the production and sale of the t-shirt.
