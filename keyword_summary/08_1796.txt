the appellant relied on the approach taken in statham v federal commissioner of taxation (1988) 20 atr 228.
the question for determination in statham was strikingly different from the question whether a person is the prescribed fit and proper person.
such an evaluation is quite different from determining the application of s 25(1) or s 26(a) of the act to undisputed facts as was the case in statham .
