the federal magistrate did not consider that dr zahirul hoq mollah had been authorised by the appellant to act as his authorised recipient.
the judgment involved a breach of procedural fairness as there was no public information to indicate that dr zahirul hoq mollah was someone who was not a fit and proper person to conduct a review.
he said that he had relied on dr mollah and had assumed that dr mollah had acted appropriately in dealing with the department on his behalf.
