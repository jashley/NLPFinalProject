i do not think batt is distinguishable.
batt 16 in batt the tribunal determined that mr batt be reclassified for pension entitlements and that the board pay him interest on the difference between his original (b class) and reclassified (a class) pension amount for a specified period.
this is because no right to receive the pension at the reclassified rate arises before the decision on classification or reclassification is made.
