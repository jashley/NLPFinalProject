whilst the tribunal accepted that the appellant was a citizen of bangladesh and a hindu by religion, the tribunal rejcted the appellant's claims of persecution for reason of his religion.
the appellant claimed that subsequently he became the founding general secretary of a community youth force to protect temples from the rioting (known as the durga protection committee) and that he was well-known in the community.
the appellant fled bangladesh after riots in 1990 between hindus and muslims regarding the babri mosque.
