consideration of the motion i am satisfied that the confidential material relied upon by asic discloses the existence and identity of an informer or informers to asic other than mr cummins.
the exact number of informers is irrelevant for present purposes; (b) the identity of mr stuart cummins as an informer to asic in relation to the affairs of multiplex has been disclosed.
the only significant change since my earlier order is that the identity of mr cummins as an informer to asic has been disclosed and the identity of another informer or other informers has not been disclosed.
