although i do not equate the recommender with the decision-maker in this case, it seems to me that the specific reference to that material which was before that party brings it within the penumbra which is reasonably producible on discovery.
it is true that the recommender obviously gave thought to these criteria in the course of his mental processes, but what use is made of them, if any, in forming his view is quite unclear.
4 paragraph (d) is a coverall and i do not think anything is gained from that category.
