the plaintiff, huntley management limited (huntley) relies on these provisions for the final relief it seeks against the defendant australian olives limited (aol) in this proceeding, because huntley contends that the re of the registered mis, australian olives project no 3 (scheme), has changed from aol to huntley for the purposes of those sections.
just as lodgment did not overcome the ineffectiveness for their purpose of the non-deeds, so registration does not overcome any ineffectiveness of the purported removal of aol and appointment of huntley in the present case.
even on the assumption that there was a valid removal of aol and appointment of huntley, those who had dealt with aol on the faith of the register would be safe in continuing to do so until the register was altered to name huntley as the new re.
