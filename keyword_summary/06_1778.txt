3 section 206 reads: '206 polling booths shall have separate voting compartments, constructed so as to screen voters from observation while they are making their ballot-papers, and each voting compartment shall be furnished with a pencil for the use of voters.
that sets out that the applicant had found the voting booths provided to voters at the polling place at the manjimup town hall on 9 october 2004 did not adequately screen voters from observation and that other persons could observe voters while they were marking their ballot-papers.
