they are denied by ms saunders.
it would appear that the applicant is concerned that ms saunders was a member of the public interest law clearing house ('pilch') in 2004 when pilch refused to assist the applicant to bring proceedings against the first respondent, and in the process of considering the applicant's request to pilch ms saunders obtained "confidential documents" from the applicant.
7 without going into the relationship between pilch, ms saunders and russell kennedy, there is simply no evidence to suggest that either ms saunders or russell kennedy was provided with confidential information of the applicant.
