whilst in mimia v szfhc , the appellant failed to respond to a hearing invitation issued by the tribunal and in navx v mimia and nasf v mimia , the respective appellant elected not to attend before the tribunal in response to an invitation, these differences, it is said, do not give rise to any constraint upon the general principle identified by the respondent.
accordingly, it is not correct to describe either navx v mimia or nasf v mimia as authorities guiding or informing the exercise of the discretion conferred upon the tribunal by s 426a on the footing that they represent 'similar circumstances' (as federal magistrate barnes observed at [15]).
applicant szfhc contended that in those circumstances an obligation fell upon the tribunal to 'find another method of contacting the respondent' [38].
