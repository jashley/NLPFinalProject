thus i do not consider that these mattresses were anticipatory.
some manufacturers were referring to it as a "no-turn mattress" or "no-turn pillowtop" and the respondent has adopted the same words and also the words "non-flip mattress" or non-flip pillowtop".
i consider this gives those mattresses a distinctly different visual impression from that of the mattress in the registered design.
