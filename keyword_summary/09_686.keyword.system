central to a mis is the responsible entity (re).
within div 1 of that part, s 601fa provides that the re of a registered mis must be a public company that holds an australian financial services licence authorising it to operate a mis.
it is not every managed investment scheme (mis) that must be registered: see s 601ed of the act.
