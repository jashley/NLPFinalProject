the university sues sirtex medical limited (sirtex), a public company established to develop and market the technology.
despite being put on inquiry of these matters it was said by sirtex that the university chose not to take any action to vindicate the rights it asserted against dr gray, sirtex or cri and chose not to communicate with sirtex.
in addition sirtex said that between 26 march 2003 and 26 october 2004 the university knew each fact upon which it based the claim which it asserted against dr gray, sirtex and cri and despite such knowledge consciously concealed its claims from sirtex and thereby stood by and permitted sirtex to make profits ([176a]).
