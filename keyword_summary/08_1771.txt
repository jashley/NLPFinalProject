a tribunal member cannot blunder into bad faith, no matter how stupid and careless the tribunal member is, any more than a person can blunder into deceit... what is required to make out this case is to find that the tribunal member was recreant to his duty by wilfully and deliberately making the impugned decision without attempting to carry out the statutory duty lying upon him -- tossing a coin without reading the file, allowing in every third applicant, or allowing in applicants from various countries in rotation might be examples.
