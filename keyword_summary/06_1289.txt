the tribunal added, however, that if fegents pharmacy were to be considered the application would fail by reason of rule 6(b)(ii).
the tribunal's findings and conclusion 3 in applying rule 6 to the proposed premises the tribunal considered two pharmacies in the blacktown area, fegents pharmacy and chemworld chemist.
the application fails on the respondent's interpretation because chemworld chemist is the nearest to the applicant's proposed premises by straight line measurement (less than 1.5 kilometres) and fegent's pharmacy is the nearest by lawful access measurement (less than 2 kilometres).
