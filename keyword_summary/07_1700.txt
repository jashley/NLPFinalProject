(7) in view of the finding that the applicant is not a reliable witness, the tribunal is not convinced that he was an eel farmer and involved in a dispute with the mentougou council over land resumption.
the appellant had claimed that in 1989 he commenced fish farming with a contract from the mentougou town council which gave him 20 years of guaranteed rights to fish particular ponds.
clearly, the applicant cannot be both a vice-director of the beijing intelligence exchange and married as claimed when he applied for a tourist visa to visit australia and an unmarried eel farmer as claimed in his protection visa application.
