nevertheless there was admitted on the pleadings by arma the circumstance that mr teves was a registered valuer who had undertaken valuations on behalf of arma 'at all material times'.
his wife, vivienne teves ('mrs teves'), was recorded by asic as having been a director at least during that controversial period of three years, though she was apparently replaced by mr teves at the time of his re-appointment subsequently in july 2004.
as i recorded at [7] of my earlier reasons for judgment, mr teves apparently signed the valuations on behalf of arma which are presently in issue, by implication as author thereof.
