... separatist militants were responsible for numerous, serious human rights abuses, including extrajudicial executions and other political killings, torture, and brutality.
in its decision, the tribunal agreed that the early part of the 1990s was one of the bloodiest chapters in india's post-independence history and that extensive human rights abuses took place in punjab at the height of the separatist movement.
many of these abuses are generated by intense social tensions, violent secessionist movements and the authorities' attempts to repress them, and deficient police methods and training.
