i do not accept that the applicant changed his membership to the marxist party whilst he was at school.
as i do not accept that the applicant was ever a member of a marxist party, i do not accept that the applicant returned to india from oman in september 2004 and resumed his interest in the marxist party thereby resulting in an attack by members of the rss which caused him injury.
he also claims that he does not wish to be a member of the marxist party and that he will be targeted for harm by members of the marxist party for reasons of his rejection of his previous membership.
