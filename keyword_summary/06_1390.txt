meinhardt was the only obvious respondent, the applicant also served mr meinhardt's children, the residuary beneficiaries under his will.
in the absence of any grant of probate, i do not believe i should regard the named executors as the trustees of mr meinhardt's estate.
mckenzie and mr t.j browne, the named executors under mr meinhardt's will (although without the grant of probate), were excused from further attendance, with the question of their costs being reserved.
