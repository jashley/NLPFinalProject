thus, the modified advertisement does not represent that the eveready super heavy duty battery is the only direct competitor (within the eveready range of batteries) of the duracell alkaline batteries.
there are other equally likely possibilities, such as, that the price of the duracell battery will not be more than "up to three times greater" than the price of the eveready shd battery, or that the price of the duracell battery will not be so much greater than the price of the eveready shd battery that a buyer of the duracell battery will get value for money.
in the absence of a representation, implication or impression that the eveready super heavy duty battery is the only eveready competitor, i do not think that the disclosure of other competitive products in the eveready alkaline range, having similar performance characteristics to duracell's alkaline battery, is necessary to prevent the comparison from being misleading.
