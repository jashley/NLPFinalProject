4 mr. hines, counsel for mr. evans, appeared on the application concerning the making of orders but does not contest the making of the orders as between the liquidator and the commissioner.
3 as a consequence of a mediation which took place in december, to which mr. evans was invited but did not attend, mr. young and the commissioner have reached an arrangement and now wish to have orders made.
mr. evans was represented by mr. hines, who sought leave to make substantial amendments to the pleadings, and to file further affidavits in support, which would necessitate a substantial adjournment and require vacation of the hearing dates.
