the magistrate said that there may be an argument that where an applicant is not represented by a migration agent, a letter inviting the applicant to a hearing should be addressed to him in a language that he can understand, but, equally, it might be said that a person applying for refugee status who receives an important-looking letter from the tribunal to which he has made an application has his own responsibility to ensure that he understands what the letter says.
