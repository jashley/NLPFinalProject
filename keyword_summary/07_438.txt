buchanan j: 1 by an application, filed in this court on 22 november 2006, the applicant, marek sapula, sought remedies in respect of his termination of employment.
3 it became clear, during the course of the directions hearings, which have so far taken place, and mr sapula accepts, that in fact he had not made any complaint to an organisation outside his employment.
that decision seems to me to be directly on point and adds further support for what, in any event in this case, appears clearly enough from the statutory provisions, namely that mr sapula has no cause of action arising under s 659 of the workplace relations act 1996 (cth).
