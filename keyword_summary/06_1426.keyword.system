14 before me this morning mr boccabella pressed that the appellant's case has merit, and that this should influence my approach to making a costs order in this matter.
&#8226; alternatively, mr boccabella submitted in court this morning that an alternative approach could be for the court to adjourn hearing this matter in relation to the costs of the appeal until after the decision of jarrett fm in the substantive matter is delivered.
this principle was adopted in latoudis v casey [1990] hca 59 ; (1990) 170 clr 534 per mason cj at 543, toohey j at 563 and mchugh j at 567 in the context of both civil and criminal proceedings.
