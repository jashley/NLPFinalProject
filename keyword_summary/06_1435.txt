nobody would struggle to stop a party raising a matter before the court if the party has not actually bargained it away entirely.
but, in circumstances where, as i am inclined to think, a reasonable expectation has arisen that there was nothing further to come in litigation between the parties, we are in the area of discretion and, i think, possibly unconscientious conduct --- an area where the court carefully moulds its remedies.
