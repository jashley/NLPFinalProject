3 i have heard brief evidence from two psychiatrists, dr jureidini and dr frukacz.
dr jureidini thinks that he may also have an underlying psychotic illness but dr frukacz does not.
dr jureidini is sufficiently concerned to say that his mental condition is likely to deteriorate to such an extent that he would not permit him to travel, notwithstanding the conditions upon which the proposed removal is to take place.
