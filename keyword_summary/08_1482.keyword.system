the applicant, mr goodman, brings this representative proceeding against the respondent, his former investment adviser.
mr shaw says the respondent is nevertheless covered by the insurance policy by reason of s 40 (3) of the insurance contracts act 1984 (cth).
while i have not formed any firm view about the merits of the case, mr shaw has shown that the applicant's claim has a solid foundation, as does the respondent's claim for indemnity against the insurer.
