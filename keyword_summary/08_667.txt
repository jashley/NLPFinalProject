there has, in my view, been an important benefit secured by this proceeding in the administration of the foi act by centrelink notwithstanding mr duncan's lack of success.
associate: dated: 14 may 2008 counsel for the applicant: mr r j c mccormack (pro bono) counsel for the respondent: mr j d allanson sc solicitor for the respondent: australian government solicitor date of hearing: 25 january 2008 date of judgment: 14 may 2008 austlii: copyright policy | disclaimers | privacy policy | feedback url: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/fca/2008/667.html
it is not unfair to say that mr duncan's requests and in the event this litigation have been instrumental in leading centrelink to an understanding of its responsibilities under the two acts and of its compliance obligations.
