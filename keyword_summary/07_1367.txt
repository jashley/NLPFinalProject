it also seems to me that the distinction sought to be drawn in relation to sreika [2007] fca 1647 is unconvincing.
if the point made by the present respondent is correct, and a proceeding is only commenced once, then i do not think that sreika [2007] fca 1647 can be distinguished in the way to which counsel for the respondent refers.
the respondent submits that the decision in sreika [2007] fca 1647 can be distinguished because the history of the proceeding was different, it having been intended to have been commenced as a representative proceeding --- it was, thus, simply a question of a wrong form being used.
