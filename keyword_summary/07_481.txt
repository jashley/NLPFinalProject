the scissor assemblies are fastened to upright support members by mounts.
the sockets and mounts provide pivotal connections for the scissor bars, without being compressive; the sidewalls act to resist lateral and torsional deflections of the outer end portions of the edge scissor assemblies and thus the scissor assemblies themselves.
the end portions of the scissor assemblies 'thereby ' form 'planar contact surfaces' with the sidewalls.
