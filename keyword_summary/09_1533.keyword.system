he deposes that shortly after mr moles's licence became operational, it was obvious to everyone involved that there was a significant overlap in the market between the operation being conducted by mr salcedo, yet another of the individuals penalised on 23 october, and mr owen, and, further, with mr moles's licence being operated by mr maughan.
