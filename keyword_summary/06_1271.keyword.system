8 the tribunal accepted that the appellant was a member of the unp and had provided some assistance during the elections in december 2002 and april 2004.
18 the tribunal simply did not accept the appellant's claims concerning the incidents following the elections in april 2004.
however, i would say the stoning of my home on the night of the april elections and wanting to set fire to it[,] my wife being threatened at gunpoint while i was at work and the assault upon me on 30 april 2004 when at the gate of my house and the other threats and harassment were of serious harm.
