although the proceedings were initiated by mrs tracy as director of janling pty ltd, the significance of the provision of instructions can only relate to the period during which the proceedings were maintained by janling pty ltd.
the first and second respondents have already had the benefit of a costs order against janling pty ltd for the period prior to 16 february 2006 when the applicants were substituted for janling pty ltd in the primary proceedings.
notwithstanding the deeds of assignment of the causes of action from the applicants to mrs tracy and then from mrs tracy to janling pty ltd, from 16 february 2006 janling pty ltd had no involvement in the proceedings and mrs tracy had no lawful capacity to provide any instructions for the conduct of the proceedings.
