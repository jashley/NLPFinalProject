6 the trial judge said that it was open to the tribunal to reach its conclusion that it did not believe that the sit-in occurred and that consequently the claimed consequences of the sit-in ensued ([2005] fmca 1377 at [13]).
in the appellant's notice of appeal filed on 21 september 2005, two grounds were advanced in support of the appeal from the decision of the federal magistrates court given on 7 september 2005 ( szext v minister for immigration [2005] fmca 1377).
