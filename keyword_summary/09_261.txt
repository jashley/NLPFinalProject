mr dubler sc, who appears for the trustee, submitted this morning that his cross-examination is not being used for that purpose.
i will therefore, upon the undertakings to the court that have been offered by mr dubler, refuse the application for leave to appeal.
the undertaking which mr dubler is prepared to give is that he will not permit the cross-examination of mr hill to amount to a dress rehearsal of the examination summons.
