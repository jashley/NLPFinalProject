9 on 21 april 2006, i made orders striking out the applicant's notice to admit facts dated 12 april 2006, which was made on a totally untenable basis.
this was pointed out in a letter from the respondent's solicitors to the applicant dated 11 april 2006.
i also confirmed my previous order of 10 march 2006 that the applicant file and serve all her evidence by 28 april 2006.
