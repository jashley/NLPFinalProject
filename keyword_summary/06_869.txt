from my own experience, i just don't think judy bowey reacts well in a crisis.
he complains that ms bowey and ms nocella continued to deal with the first respondent's claims "despite their possession of considerable evidence to the effect that her complaint was vexatious".
i can believe that ms kennedy put on a good show for luisa nocella and luisa's attitude towards me reflected a genuine belief i had done something wrong.
