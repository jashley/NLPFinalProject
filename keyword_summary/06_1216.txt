he developed a process to produce calcium phosphopeptide calcium phosphate complexes ("cpp-calcium phosphate complexes") and studied the molecular structure of these calcium phosphopeptide calcium phosphate complexes.
the phosphopeptide contains the cluster sequence.
this stability is obtained by the phosphopeptide binding the calcium phosphate.
