the word 'information' in s 424a(1) imports at least some positive factual material and does not apply where the tribunal has identified a lack of information: see szbcs v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2005] fca 1457 per bennett j at [23]; mzwpk v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2005] fca 1256 per heerey j at [14]; and tran v the minister for immigration &amp; multicultural affairs [2002] fca 1522 per kenny j at [25]-[26].
as sackville j correctly observed, everything depends upon the grounds of review, and the circumstances of the case.
in support of his reasoning, his honour indicated that he was bound to follow the decision of heerey j in szcjd v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2006] fca 609 at [38] - [43] .
