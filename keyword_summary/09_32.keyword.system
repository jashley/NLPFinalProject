on 18 april 2008 this application by mr soh was dismissed by madgwick j: see soh v commonwealth of australia [2008] fca 520 , where his honour has set out the history of the application and the issues involved.
mr soh then filed a notice of appeal on 15 may 2008 from the orders of madgwick j and on 28 may 2008 sought an extension of time to file the notice of appeal.
these reasons concern an application by mr soh for an extension of time and leave to appeal against orders of moore j made on 14 october 2008 requiring mr soh to provide security for costs in a form acceptable to the commonwealth in an amount of $30,000 by 4.00 pm on 14 december 2008, and a consequential order that if the applicant did not comply then the proceedings should be dismissed.
