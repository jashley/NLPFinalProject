the applicant submitted that in briefing senior counsel the respondents were being 'overcautious'.
the applicant's pleaded claim is more fully described in the reasons of french j in lashansky v bruvecchis pty ltd [2004] fca 837.
in my opinion, the respondents should not be exposed to the further cost and inconvenience that would inevitably arise if i were to permit mr lashansky to replead.
