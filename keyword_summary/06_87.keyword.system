1 this is an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against a judgment of a federal magistrate of 9 august 2005.
the decision of the federal magistrate was made against a background where the applicant had already litigated, in the federal magistrates court, the federal court of australia and the high court, the issue of whether the tribunal's decision was attended by jurisdictional error.
that application concerned a decision of the refugee review tribunal of 17 june 2003 in which the tribunal affirmed the decision of a delegate of the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs ("the minister") to refuse to grant the applicant a protection visa.
