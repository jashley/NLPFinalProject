on 27 january 2005, a follow-up meeting occurred between ms devers, mr rickard, mr brookhouse, ms foster, ms kuzilny and ms gibbins to resolve the issues between them and ms devers.
mr guest replied that focus would "play it by ear".
that evidence is inconsistent with the evidence of mr guest and ms van opijnen.
