there are two subsidiary issues about the admissibility of other parts of the affidavits of mr vickery, mr rowland and mr gillogly as evidence relevant to reliance and of the affidavits of mr vickery and mr rowland as admissions.
paragraph 7 of mr rowland's affidavit can be dismissed as mr rowland could not recall mr adams' response other than that he was not satisfied with it.
the conversations with mr gillogly and mr vickery also involve a comparison between the cost of imported and domestic grain.
