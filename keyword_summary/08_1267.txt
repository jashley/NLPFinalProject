mr mitchell effectively disavowed any threat by mr bannister that the grouters "would shed up".
he said he gave the disputed work, which the grouters claimed as their work, to mr anton but it had not been promised to the grouters.
mr armstrong or mr mitchell were free to allocate the work to mr anton or the grouters.
