westpac has no operating procedures for creditnet, which is also unusual.
we would expect to have proceedures (sic) in place if creditnet was a reputable international clearer.
7 i note in passing that there is nothing in the documentation before me which provides any details at all concerning creditnet which is otherwise referred to in the material as "creditnet banking international&eacute;".
