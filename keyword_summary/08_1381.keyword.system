what is ms reading's rate of pay?
i find the complaint substantiated.
in dr reading's complaint lodged with the commission electronically on sunday, 31 december 2006, she describes circumstances which had ensued over a period of time saying that the events being complained about were 'long standing last 2-3 years' and 'worse this year january to december'.
