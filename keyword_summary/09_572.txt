on 2 december 2008, one of the group members, nestor aguda, opted out of the representative proceeding.
steps were taken removing nestor aguda as a group member from the representative proceeding and adding the nine additional individuals to the group members.
further, contract blinds was in breach of the contracts of employment as a result of a failure to pay the whole of the superannuation contributions to which the second applicant and the group members were entitled, because contract blinds had calculated superannuation contributions by reference to the underpaid wages.
