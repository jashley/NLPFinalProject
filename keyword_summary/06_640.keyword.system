hence pcl has sought to join macquarie, and subsequently svb as well, as respondents to the proceedings commenced initially against arma and mr teves.
the insurers submitted that there was no averment or evidence at all about mr teves' role or association with arma at the time of the commencement of operation of the first policy, or about 'any negotiations between the insured and the insurer relating to the decision to name mr stewart (and not mr teves) in the policy', and that there was therefore no basis, pleaded or otherwise, for the proposition that the first policy was intended to include valuations undertaken or signed by mr teves.
