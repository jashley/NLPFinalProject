14 in citrix systems inc v telesystems learning pty ltd (in liq) (1998) 28 acsr 529, moore j made an order that a company be wound up in insolvency in circumstances where it was being wound up voluntarily, and there was no suggestion that an order terminating the voluntary winding up was necessary.
