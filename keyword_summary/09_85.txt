this is an appeal against an order of the federal magistrates court of 2 october 2008 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the refugee review tribunal in connection with refusal of a protection (class xa) visa under s 65 of the migration act 1958 (cth) ( szdbf v minister for immigration &amp; anor [2008] fmca 1379).
secondly, that the federal magistrates court erred by not finding that the tribunal denied the appellant procedural fairness in that the tribunal drew adverse conclusions about the appellant not being involved in student politics or with the bharatiya janata party (bjp), these being conclusions that were not obviously open on the known material and without giving the appellant an opportunity to be heard about those matters.
