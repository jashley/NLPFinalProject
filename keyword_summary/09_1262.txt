section 45 is an instance of the operation of s 7 of the nta to control the interrelation between the nta and the rda.
this is not a case where there is a closely analogous full court authority giving rise to the kind of 'routine judicial task' as that expression was used in dexcam .
analysis the question of statutory interpretation and the application of the rda requires consideration of the decision of the high court in ward in relation to the effect on native title of mining tenure granted before the commencement of the nta but after the commencement of the rda, that is to say, in relation to pre-1994 mining leases.
