' i do not think that the observations of jacobson j made in szgzw may be transposed to the context in which this first appellant responded as above as recorded by nicholls fm.
jacobson j observed at [39]-[40] and [41] of szgzw (so far as is material) as follows: ... the difficulty with the approach which the federal magistrate adopted was that he made findings of fact without hearing any evidence from the appellant.
' aside from whatever may have been the content of the 'untested statements made from the bar table' in szgzw , and irrespective of what the objective circumstances might have evinced in any event, the context of the present case can be distinguished from that addressed by jacobson j in szgzw , in that his honour was there addressing circumstances where the tribunal had challenged an assertion made by the appellant upon the basis solely of statements made by that appellant from the bar table.
