ms crocker's complaint was that the trustee had refused to pay her a benefit in consequence of her being totally and permanently disabled.
the trustee was required to formulate and give effect to an investment strategy for the fund by s52(2)(f) of the sis act.
his honour circumvented this problem by holding that the compromise clause applied because ms crocker's claim was against the fund and was not a personal claim against the trustee.
