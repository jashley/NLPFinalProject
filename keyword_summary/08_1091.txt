3 the substantive proceeding was commenced by the respondents ("the trustees"), as trustees in bankruptcy of the bankrupt estates of arthur john andony and joan elizabeth andony ("the andonys").
22 paragraph 10.6 of the defence is as follows: 10.6 say further or alternatively that by reason that mrs andony obtained the benefit of the performance of the obligations of the second respondent pursuant to the deed dated 1 april 2003, including the discharge of mrs andony's liability to the second respondent with respect to loan funds borrowed by mrs andony jointly with mr andony from the second respondent, mrs andony thereby ratified the conduct of mr andony if and to the extent (if any, which is denied) that such conduct was beyond the authority of mr andony.
4 the trustees seek orders voiding certain transactions between devere, packham and the andonys and vesting certain property, held by packham and castleworld, in the trustees.
