mr rogers says that the notice was served at number 13 moreton street, toogoom notwithstanding that the mortgagee knew from documents provided to the mortgagee by mr rogers that he resided at number 15, moreton street, toogoom.

mr rogers agreed to transfer the toogoom property into the name of alc and, subject to the transfer, alc agreed to allow mr rogers to reside rent free in the toogoom property for a period of six months and granted an option to mr rogers or his nominee to purchase the toogoom property within a period of six months from transfer of the property, for a nominated price.
