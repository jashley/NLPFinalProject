in broad terms, hawthorn glen's submissions were that the evidence of messrs phillpot and jasper should not be accepted in a number of respects.
at its highest, this evidence is directed to the credit of aconex, and messrs phillpot and jasper in particular, and even then it is of marginal probative value in relation to an attack on the credit of mr phillpot and mr jasper.
no application to lead further evidence from mr phillpot was made at the conclusion of his cross-examination.
