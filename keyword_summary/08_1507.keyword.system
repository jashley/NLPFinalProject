(wilcox j in hunter valley developments pty ltd v cohen (1984) 3 fcr 344 at 348-349.
background 2 as explained in the decision of dowsett j of 2 april 2003 ( robert joseph barry garvey v secretary, department of family and community services [2003] fca 340) events relevant to the decision of his honour, and the application currently before me, date back to december 1985.
in this respect i consider that the application before me, as was the notice of appeal before dowsett j, is an abuse of process.
