5 on the face of its reply the university relies entirely upon the facts of dr gray's alleged non-disclosure of the relevant patentable invention and intellectual property as causative of its failure to commence proceedings before 21 december 2004 and as supportive of the estoppel which it raises.
the university further pleads that by reason of dr gray's conduct and non-compliance with what are called the "prompt notification" and "prompt reporting" conditions, it did not know that it had and was unable to pursue any causes of action in relation to breaches of these conditions prior to 21 december 2004.
