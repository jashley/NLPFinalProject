the appellant faced the same difficulties with the claims against the repatriation commission as against the mrcc.
the appellant failed to satisfy the federal magistrate of that: (a) because his compensation claim against the mrcc was not a claim against the respondent --- the status of the mrcc under s 363 of the military rehabilitation and compensation act 2004 (cth) and of the respondent under s 9(1) of the defence act 1903 (cth) was considered; and (b) because there was "virtually no evidence" of the details or the quantum of his claim against the mrcc, and nothing to show that he had reasonable prospects of recovering a significant amount in that claim.
faulkner v bluett is an illustration of the first of those categories.
