the related party creditors include richland pty limited (richland), the trustee of mr wong's family trust, in the sum of $8,020,048.
the commission has raised a concern that richland has outside creditors and that, as a consequence of the extinguishment of the debt owing to richland by the two companies, those creditors may be prejudiced.
10 it would of course be open to the commission, if it was concerned with the administration of any company, as it was with these two companies, to intervene and, if need be, notify creditors of richland, or require richland to notify its creditors, of the steps that richland is proposing to take in relation to the deed of company arrangement.
