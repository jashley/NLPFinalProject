the appellant's oral testimony was that the maoists were motivated by revenge for the events of 1998.
there was no direct evidence as to the motivations of the maoists vis-&agrave;-vis the applicant for the tribunal to consider, other than the applicant's testimony that the maoists were motivated by "revenge" for the events of 1998 .
first, the appellant's view of the motives of the maoists who made the threats could hardly be determinative.
