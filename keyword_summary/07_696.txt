on 12 january 2007, the accc's solicitors wrote to dataline's previous liquidator responding to the letter of 19 december 2006 and requested administrative reinstatement of dataline's registration.
the accc contended that dataline had failed to comply with the order and, as a result, dataline's defence was struck out.
17 the applicant further says that reinstatement is just as the accc sought to secure the consent of dataline's former liquidator to administrative reinstatement of dataline by asic pursuant to s 601ah(1) and dataline's former liquidator refused to do so.
