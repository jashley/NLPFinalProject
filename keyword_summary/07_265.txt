the tribunal concluded, having regard to the appellant's medical certificates, that his headaches was caused by hypertension and overwork and not as a result of mistreatment by chinese authorities.
moreover, the tribunal found that the appellant was able to answer questions unrelated to falun gong without difficulty, that his health problems were not the result of persecution in china but of hypertension and overwork and thus that his inability to answer falun gong questions was unrelated to his health.
the tribunal did not accept his falun gong related claims nor did it accept that he was threatened against practising falun gong or that this was the reason he had not practiced falun gong in australia.
