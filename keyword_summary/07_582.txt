9 mr carl moller has been heard on the application to limit the use to be made of mr jack moller's evidence in the case against mr carl moller.
mr carl moller was invited to direct the court's attention to the irremediable harm that would be done to mr carl moller's case were the evidence of mr jack moller to be excised.
