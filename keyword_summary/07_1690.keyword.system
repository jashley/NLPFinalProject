mr wilson did not explain the basis of this second calculation and why the first calculation was wrong.
mr trevor wilson of the respondents deposed in an affidavit of 15 june 2007, that over an eight week period the amount of fees and interest that would accrue on the amount claimed was $597,047.
however, in a subsequent affidavit sworn on 18 june 2007, mr wilson deposed that the interest and additional risk fees were accruing at a rate of $508,097 per month, and that the previous calculation was wrong.
