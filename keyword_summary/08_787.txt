there was debate before me as to the contact (if any) between the appellant and the scheme legal practitioner, mr urquijo.
the first respondent put forward an affidavit which detailed a conversation between the solicitor acting for the first respondent and mr urquijo.
under interpreters there is a notification that the language/dialect spoken by the interpreter was mandarin/fujian.
