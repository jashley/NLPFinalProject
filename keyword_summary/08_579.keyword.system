one of the orders that attracted some controversy is a proposal for an order that the operation of paras 27 and 28 of the search orders made on 18 and 19 march 2008 as against the first respondent in the proceedings, mr michael young, be extended until 7 may 2008.
6 mr horak makes submissions that, in order to extend order 27, which is in these terms, 'except for the sole purpose of obtaining legal advice, you (mr young), must not until 4.30 pm on the return date directly or indirectly inform any person of this proceeding or of the contents of this order or tell any person that a proceeding has been or may be brought against you by the applicant' and order 28, a notice of motion ought to have been filed seeking specifically that relief.
