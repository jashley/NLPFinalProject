the tribunal had considered the claim as an ethnic chinese and as a chinese christian and considered the cumulative effects.
it noted in its decision that many of the reports referred to chinese christians rather than chinese generally because many chinese were christian and that ethnic identity often overlapped with religious identity in the area where the appellant lived.
the tribunal was satisfied that the authorities had both the will and capacity to provide adequate and effective protection for the chinese minority.
