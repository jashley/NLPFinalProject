1 i was approached urgently tonight in this appeal to grant bail to the appellant pending an opportunity for a hearing on whether or not he should be granted bail or the orders for his weekend detention should be stayed.
4 on the basis that the appellant would have been entitled to bail tonight, pending the determination of his appeal by the district court, it seems to me that there are sufficient circumstances to justify my making an order admitting him to bail and staying the operation of his sentence up to and including next thursday.
