the administrative body gave the matter adequate consideration in randhawa (at 443 per black cj, at 452-453 per beaumont j), but not in naiz (at [22] per branson j with whom north j agreed).
i reject this submission.
i say that because the appellant did not raise the claimed connection before the hearing ( szjub v minister for immigration and citizenship [2007] fca 1486 at [21] per bennett j; szdtm v minister for immigration and citizenship [2008] fca 1258 at [72] per dowsett j).
