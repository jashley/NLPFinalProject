the applicant is mr michael bonan and the respondent is mr nigel hadgkiss.
i accept mr jacobs' submissions that there is no suggestion that ms boots will deliberately prejudice the investigation.
however, consistent with ms boots' duty to mr bonan, i accept that there is a real risk that ms boots may unintentionally, perhaps subconsciously, reveal to mr bonan matters that would in effect forewarn him.
