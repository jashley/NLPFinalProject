the appellant also asserts that actual charges against mr ibrahim were immaterial because the appellant was protesting the political persecution of mr ibrahim rather than the specific charges laid.
the appellant claimed that he had donated money to the njp and demonstrated at the trial of mr anwar ibrahim in 2001.
moreover the tribunal did not find it believable that the appellant would be dismissed from his job while another, more politically active, staff member ('mr s') was only demoted.
