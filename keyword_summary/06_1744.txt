12 before his honour in the federal magistrates court it was agreed between the parties that the appellant had joined the macabenta class action in or about february 1998.
as i have noted, in light of the fact that the macabenta class action was the subject of a special leave application which was only dismissed in june 1999, it is now clear that the appellant's delay in the period of his involvement in the macabenta action went right up to the time he joined the muin and lie class action.
