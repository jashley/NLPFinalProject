the only exception i would make is that as i am satisfied that through no fault of his own the applicant was not able to appear at the hearing on 1 march 2006.
(revised from the transcript) 1 for reasons expressed earlier today i set aside the orders which i made on 1 march 2006 because the applicant had given the court an explanation for his non attendance and i considered it in the interests of justice that he be allowed to be heard.
i adopt the reasons which i gave on 1 march 2006, before i had the benefit of hearing the applicant, as explaining the reasons in law why i am of opinion that there would be no sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave on the basis of the material before me today and i am not satisfied that there would be any injustice caused to the applicant, let alone a substantial injustice by my refusing him leave to appeal.
