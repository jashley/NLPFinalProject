in australia the stay is justified on the basis that it prevents a multiplicity of actions against the company which would be expensive, time consuming and, sometimes, unnecessary: ogilvie-grant v east (1983) 7 aclr 669 , 671---2; vagrand pty ltd (in liq) v fielding (1993) 41 fcr 550 , 554---5; cf re sydney formworks pty ltd (in liq) [1965] nswr 646 , 649---50.
whatever be the correct rationale, the circumstances in the case at bar make it appropriate to allow both the action commenced by beconwood securities pty ltd and beconwood ltd (together "beconwood") against opes prime stockbroking ltd (in liquidation) (receivers and managers appointed) ("opes"), which began before opes' liquidation, and the proposed cross-claim by australia and new zealand banking group ltd ("anz") against opes to proceed.
otherwise the winding up would result in a scramble for assets.
