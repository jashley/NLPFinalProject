12 mr wood also referred me to a decision of a full court of this court in lloyd werft bremerhaven gmbh v the owners of the ship zoya kosmodemyanskaya as surrogate for the ships taras schevchenko, delphin and kazakhstan and tor shipping co [1997] 1162 fca (31 october 1997).
13 i do not consider that the observations of the full court in zoya are of assistance.
14 zoya was not a case in which there was a question of submission to the jurisdiction; the matter involved the construction and application of s 19 of the admiralty act 1988 (cth).
