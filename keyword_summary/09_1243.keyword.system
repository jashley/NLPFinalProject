i agree.
as the appellant had not appeared before the tribunal, it had insufficient evidence to make any specific finding about the appellant's claims of his fear of harm by reason of being a shia muslim.
as to ground 2 (failure by the tribunal to consider an integer of the appellant's claim, being whether a shia muslim was at risk of harm in pakistan from hard-line sunni muslims and not able to access effective protection), the federal magistrate (at [23]) found that, as the first respondent ( the minister ) submitted, the tribunal's role was to make factual findings with respect to the particular appellant, not shia muslims in pakistan generally.
