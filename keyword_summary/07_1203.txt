that section sought to restrict the power of the high court to grant "a remedy...in relation to a migration decision" in circumstances where the applicant had failed to comply with the prescribed time limits in commencing his or her claim in the high court.
counsel for the plaintiff advanced cogent reasons why the phrase "a remedy...in relation to a migration decision" should not be given a reading which would take s 486a beyond public law remedies and into the area of what might be called collateral attack upon migration decisions.
21 in bodruddaza v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2007] hca 14 ; (2007) 234 alr 114, the respondent advanced a similar argument to that advanced in this court, as to the ambit of the words "a remedy...in relation to a migration decision" in s 486a of the act.
