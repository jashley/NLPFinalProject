mr easton says that, if i proceed with the trial of this matter next week, the trial will render nugatory any appeal that john holland may be able to pursue.
in this particular matter, i consider this factor is significant.
the serious injustice or prejudice that mr easton, on behalf of john holland, says it will suffer arises from its desire to seek leave to appeal my decision of last friday, 2 october 2009.
