paragraph 26 of the statement of claim by the accc alleges, "each of o'keefe and dargie knew each of the matters pleaded in paragraph 2, 5 to 9, 11 to 17 and 19 to 21".
proper pleading of the defence would require a statement as to whether knowledge of each of the matters alleged in par 26 of the statement of claim is contested by mr dargie, or mr o'keefe.
further, the further amended defence admits the allegation made in the statement of claim that the second respondent, mr dargie, at all material times "is and was a director, shareholder and the accounts manager of australialink"; and admits that the third respondent, mr o'keefe, at all material times, "is and was the general manager and computer systems manager of australialink".
