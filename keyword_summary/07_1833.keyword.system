28 the appellant called before the federal magistrate mr min wang, who was an assistant employed by the appellant's migration agent.
the federal magistrate had before him the evidence of the appellant which was hearsay and the evidence of mr wang, which was also hearsay.
mr tam was both an australian citizen and not prohibited from being a sponsoring spouse so the question before the delegate, and ultimately the tribunal, was whether the appellant was the spouse of mr tam for the purpose of the migration act 1958 (cth) (the act) and the regulations.
