to hold otherwise would lead to a farcical situation if the applicant was to escape from the custody of the escort prior to his transport out of australia; on his detention, he could not be held in lawful custody by the australian authorities.
the first argument is not sustainable because the applicant's lawful custody by australian authorities did not cease when he was placed in the custody of the escort.
