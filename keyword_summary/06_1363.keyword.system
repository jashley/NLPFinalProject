apart from the exceptional case in which special leave to appeal to the high court is granted, a final judgment of the full court of this court is conclusive of any issue arising under the extradition act (cf rahme v commonwealth bank of australia [1993] hca 62 ; (1993) 117 alr 618 per deane j at 620).
it is to be remembered that australia has continuing obligations to new zealand which are reflected in the terms of s 35(6) of the act.
