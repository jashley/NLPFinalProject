the patents were sealed on 27 october 2005 and issued in the names of george stack ("stack") and alan grieves ("grieves") who are said to have been the inventors.
it is pleaded that upon grant, stack and grieves held each patent on trust for gst.
that says nothing concerning the entitlement of stack and grieves jointly, or gst claiming through them.
