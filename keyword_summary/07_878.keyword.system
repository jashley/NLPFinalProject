as i held in my principal judgment (at [61] --- [63]) the relevant time at which the necessary common intention had to exist was the time at which the lease was executed in december 1996.
evidence as to one witness's state of mind in the latter part of 1997 and in 1998 could have had no bearing on his intention (assuming it to be relevant) in december 1996.
