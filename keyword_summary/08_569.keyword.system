on 4 march 2008, greenwood j ordered that the respondent file and serve its defence on or before 25 march 2008.
it was not open to the court to make an order for default judgment except on the bringing of a motion supported by evidence as to the merits of the application: see australian securities commission v mcleod (1994) 54 fcr 309 per drummond j; see also for example grey v mango prepaid calling cards pty limited [2004] fca 1664 per nicholson j, and zomba production music v roadhouse productions (2001) 190 alr 288 per stone j.
23 i am quite satisfied, having regard to ss 5 and 23 of the federal court of australia act 1976 , that i have power to make order 2 of the orders sought.
