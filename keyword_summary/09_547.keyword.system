delay was also the principal matter relied on by mr bagwe at the hearing.
as it happened, however, the minister's department failed to process mr bagwe's sponsorship application before sponsorship approval expired; and, on 17 june 2008, a ministerial delegate ultimately declined to grant mr bagwe the visa he sought.
on 20 december 2005, mr bagwe lodged an application with the minister's department for the grant of a subclass 457 visa, with freshco fruit market pty ltd as his sponsoring employer.
