i will return to this matter below.
the documents to which i have referred cover a period from 5 august 2002 to 10 october 2002 and purport individually to contain the tabulated results of investigations made by employees of amc as to whether dispensaries and retailers in hong kong were selling packages of "fuyunhon 10% urea cream 50g" which were not provided by amc.
