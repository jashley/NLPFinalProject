i do not regard bluebottle as overruling the principle articulated in mallinson.
indeed clyne was applied in bluebottle in dealing with another issue and mallinson was also referred to but not on this point.
this, in my view, is how the distinction between ss 218 and 255 referred to in bluebottle should be understood.
