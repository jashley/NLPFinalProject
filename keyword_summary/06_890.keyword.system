i reject the first submission.
he submits that he should have been given the opportunity by the tribunal to challenge mr norman's evidence about the searches conducted by the respondent of its electronic databases.
he did not articulate his submission clearly, but i take him to be saying that, although he was not deprived of an opportunity to call evidence at the hearing, and did not ask for an adjournment of the hearing so that he could gather and present evidence challenging mr norman's evidence, nevertheless, the tribunal should have given him an opportunity to challenge mr norman's evidence by suggesting an adjournment or perhaps adjourning of its own motion.
