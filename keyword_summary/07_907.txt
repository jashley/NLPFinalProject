there is ' no scope for operation of the distinction between strict compliance and substantial compliance ' in determining whether item 8202(3)(b) of sch 8 of the regulations is satisfied ( weerasinghe v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2004] fca 261 at [10] , cited in jayasekara at [5]).
either condition 8202(3)(b) is satisfied or it is not; either there is a certificate of an "at least satisfactory" academic result or there is not ( jayasekara v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs [2006] fcafc 167 ; (2006) 156 fcr 199 per heerey and sundberg jj).
