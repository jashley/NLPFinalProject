after dealing with protection of the australian community, the tribunal said: "to set aside the decision under review in the case of an unrehabilitated offender with such a serious record during his eight years in australia would, in my view, send entirely the wrong message to other non-citizens contemplating criminal behaviour.
the question is whether the tribunal considered that the section obliged it to cancel the applicant's visa, unless it was satisfied that it should not cancel the visa (see ross v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2000] fca 1716 ; 107 fcr 1 at [27] to [29], and doukmak v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs [2001] fca 1821 ; 114 fcr 432 at [50] and [51]).
