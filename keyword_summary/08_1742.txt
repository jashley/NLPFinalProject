that property was owned by confalo enterprises pty ltd ("confalo"), and the business conducted there --- called "manor gardens retirement home" --- was owned by newpark pty ltd ("newpark").
the first appellant moved to enforce its securities, constituted by the mortgages of the respondent's shares in confalo and newpark.
in part these relate to the fact that those documents had the effect that the first appellant acquired a 51% interest in confalo and newpark without being obliged to pay bufalo corp or the respondent anything.
