on 31 august 2006, mr zafiriou responded by way of facsimile enclosing an explanation to the assessment.
on the same day, mr zafiriou gave the garnishee notices to mr silvestri and jason real estate pty ltd.
if the notice of assessment was not effectively served on 25 august 2006, then the garnishee notices are invalid.
