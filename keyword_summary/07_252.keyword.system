the defendant says that had mr mcinnes clearly and fully stated the content of the grounds for a genuine dispute, the defendant would have been afforded the opportunity to withdraw the statutory demand prior to the filing of the application.
perhaps some of the costs in this application might have been avoided had mr mcinnes focused upon a precise identification of the central matters which might have demonstrated the subsistence of a genuine dispute at an earlier time and with more transparency.
