in reference to the operating lease, the commissioner relied on cl 2 sale and hire back procedure which provides: 2.1 when the hirer wishes lease plan to acquire vehicles from the hirer and to hire those vehicles back from lease plan, the hirer may provide lease plan with a complete listing of all such vehicles (including their respective current odometer readings and their written down values in the books of the hirer), their current registration certificates and a roadworthy (or similar) certificate for each vehicle.
or, as it is put by mr croes in his affidavit, the employees "sell their own motor vehicles to leaseplan australia in order to lease them back".
