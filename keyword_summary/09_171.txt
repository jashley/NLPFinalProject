relying on sheehy v repatriation commission (1996) 66 fcr 569 at 573-574, counsel contended that the applicant's remunerative activity had ceased on his suffering of the injury to his shoulders.
the requirement to consider "remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking" does not mean a particular job with a particular employer but the substantive remunerative work that the veteran had undertaken in the past.
after that, he became a person "who has not been engaged in remunerative work".
