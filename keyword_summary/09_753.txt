the cockatoo has traditional nesting areas where it returns to breed.
as the property will support fewer nesting pairs of cockatoos, fewer cockatoos will occupy and utilise the adjoining stringybark feeding habitat.
the south eastern red-tailed black cockatoo ( calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne ) ("the cockatoo") is listed as an endangered species pursuant to sub-section 178(1) of the act.
