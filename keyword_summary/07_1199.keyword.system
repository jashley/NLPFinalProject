ultimately the applicant told the tribunal that he had not practised falun gong in australia and the tribunal so found.
4 the appellant claimed that he became a member of falun gong in 1998 and that in 1999, he went to beijing to participate in falun gong activities and to ask for "legal status" for falun gong practitioners.
