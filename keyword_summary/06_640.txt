hence pcl has sought to join macquarie, and subsequently svb as well, as respondents to the proceedings commenced initially against arma and mr teves.
pcl has claimed damages in the first instance against arma as the provider of the valuations and mr teves as the author of the valuations, he being allegedly also a director of arma, but it is apparent that recovery from arma and mr teves individually is at least dubious.
the second respondent neil teves ('mr teves') was asserted by pcl to be a director and shareholder of arma, an assertion which i do not understand to have been put in issue by the insurers.
