that circumstance alone would be sufficient to lead to the conclusion that it was just not possible to conclude that the decision below was attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by this court, but when that is coupled with the fact that the making of the orders was pursuant to the exercise of a discretion and that there was no material to suggest that the discretion miscarried, one is impelled to conclude that any appeal has no prospects of success.
the second test in d&eacute;cor , whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong, is, in my view, not satisfied in this case.
