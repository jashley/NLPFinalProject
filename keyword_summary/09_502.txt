the second affidavit, of antonino calcopietro, solicitor, is more on point.
in the further amended statement of claim, the applicants say that on 24 march 2004 the principal's representative under the willowdene head contract, for and on behalf of the first respondent, issued to willowdene a notice purportedly given under clause 16 of that contract prohibiting willowdene from using the second applicant in the performance of any works under that contract.
in or about june 2002, the provision of services to the respondents became the subject of a contract known as the "willowdene head contract" and the "transfield head contract".
