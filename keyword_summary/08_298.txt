the tribunal does not accept on the evidence before it that the applicant's travel to the uae was other than employment-motivated.
the tribunal also, and again only by way of example, further concluded that: ... the tribunal dismisses the applicant's attempts to characterize his travel to the uae as flight motivated by convention-related fear as ill-conceived and poorly-argued fabrications.
the conclusions of the tribunal, for example, included the finding in respect to one claim that: ...the tribunal considers this fanciful and far-fetched claim quite typical of the kind of ill-conceived ambits presented by the applicant in the course of this case.
