mr nicholls was aware that the notice of appeal needed to be lodged by 13 august 2009.
indeed, as i have already noted, at trial mr nicholls sought an adjournment of the application, which it may be inferred his honour thought was a further delay on mr nicholls' part.
the second complaint is the failure by the primary judge to grant mr nicholls an adjournment.
