the uncontested hearsay evidence placed before the court included advice from senior counsel at the washington state attorney general's office in the united states of america suggesting that there had been 66 australian customers who purchased e-books referable to colitis, 112 australian customers who purchased e-books referable to diverticulitis, 203 australian customers who purchased e-books referable to genital warts, one who purchased an e-book referable to genital herpes, 440 australian customers who purchased e-books referable to menopause and 229 australian customers who purchased e-books referable to shingles between december 2008 and 3 june 2009.
they have, through websites on the world wide web, offered for sale e-books which have addresses suggesting that, by reference to those websites, one may learn how to defeat asthma, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, genital herpes, hemochromatosis, lyme disease, menopause, myastheniagravis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sebaceous cyst, shingles, prostate cancer, 'mm', addison's disease, anemia, cellulite, colitis, diverticulitis, endometriosis, genital warts, hemochromatosis, multiple sclerosis, reflux, staph infection, tourettes-disorder, tuberculosis, breast cancer, heartburn, ringworm, ulcers, scabies, cysts, hives, ganglion cyst, mononucleosis, gullian barre syndrome, schizophrenia, dyslexia, impetigo, gonorrhoea and larangitis.
it is clear that a number of representations contained in the material on the websites and in the e-books is false, misleading and deceptive.
