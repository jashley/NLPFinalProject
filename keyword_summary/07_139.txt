construction pty ltd (receivers &amp; managers appointed) (in liquidation) ("cwc"), john harold heard and stephen elliot young.
mr cirillo appears to accept, although this is by no means clear, that cwc remained the legal owner of the chose.
the defence of the poclain proceeding on the basis that cal had a set-off based upon moneys owed by cwc to cal which were guaranteed by cirillo, was brought by cal in the knowledge that it had no right to do so and for a predominant and improper purpose which was collateral to its defence of the poclain proceeding namely: 21.1 to increase the costs and the duration of the poclain proceeding in the expectation that cirillo would exhaust his funds and/or his preparedness to litigate against cal with regard to matters pertaining to cwc; and/or 21.2 to increase the costs and the duration of the poclain proceeding in the expectation that cirillo would be declared bankrupt and releases from litigation might then be more readily obtained from the trustee of cirillo's bankrupt estate; and/or 21.3 to maintain the fiction that cal was a creditor of cwc which would enable cal to maintain its appointment of heard and young as receivers and managers of cwc and thereby continue to maintain its control of cwc which it continues to do to this day.
