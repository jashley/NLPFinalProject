1 in this matter an extension of time is sought for filing a notice of appeal from the decision of scarlett fm made on 17 march 2006 ( szhuc v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural affairs [2006] fmca 460).
whilst the position revealed is quite unsatisfactory and has led to an unacceptable delay, i am not prepared, in this case, to penalise the applicant because of the default of his solicitor.
