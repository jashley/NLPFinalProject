i equally am not satisfied that, if the respondent ceo had complied with the statutory obligations imposed by s 13(3) of the ad(jr) act in responding to mr duncan's requests, mr duncan would not have desisted from taking the litigious course that he did even though it was as i found ultimately doomed.
in the circumstances, i am satisfied that an order that mr duncan pay 60 per cent of the respondent's costs on a party/party basis should be made.
