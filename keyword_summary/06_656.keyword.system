3 freehills act on behalf of the examinees, mr evans and david woolfe ('mr woolfe').
mr evans relies upon an affidavit of mr david ronald goodman sworn on 22 may 2006 in response to mr blundell's affidavit.
the plaintiff seeks support for this in [4.1] of a facsimile from mr goodman to mr blundell dated 8 february 2006 in which he stated that '[a]t this stage, of the documents thus far reviewed, no privilege is claimed by mr evans or by freehills'.
