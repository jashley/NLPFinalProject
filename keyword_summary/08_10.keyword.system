1 on 7 january 2008 i heard and determined the applicant's application filed on 28 december 2007, seeking a writ of habeas corpus and other relief.
on my view, the authority of the s 23 surrender warrant did not cease because the applicant was not transported out of australia; his re-transfer into the custody of australian authorities on 22 december 2007 and his continued custody by them since that date is therefore lawful.
