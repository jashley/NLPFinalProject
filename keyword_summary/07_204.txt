the appellant's case centred on the claim that his father was an active member of the bharatiya janata party ("bjp"), and, because the appellant was the eldest son of his father, he feared that his political opponents, especially the congress party workers, believed that he may seek a political position as his father had done.
notwithstanding the failure of the tribunal to observe the requirements of s 424a of the act there existed a separate and independent basis for the decision to which the tribunal came: see szcjh v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fca 1660 at [23] ; szeeu v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2006] fcafc 2 at [232] --- [233].
