1 this is an application for an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal from a judgment of a federal magistrate of 9 august 2005.
i certify that the preceding two (2) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice moore.
the application was dismissed by the federal magistrate as incompetent, because the federal magistrate concluded that the tribunal's decision was a privative clause decision and in relation to such a decision applications had to be made within specified times.
