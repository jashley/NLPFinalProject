associate: dated: 6 april 2006 applicant: appeared in person solicitor for the respondent: australian government solicitor date of hearing: 30 march 2006 date of judgment: 6 april 2006 austlii: copyright policy | disclaimers | privacy policy | feedback url: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/fca/2006/382.html
when the present proceedings were called on for hearing, the applicant was unable to articulate virtually anything by way of address to the court, because of her emotional and tearful state and condition.
following upon my adjourning the court to hear another matter and thus to allow the applicant some time for composure, the applicant was still unable to articulate orally anything approaching a viable basis for an appeal against the federal magistrate's decision, assuming that leave to appeal out of time might be granted.
