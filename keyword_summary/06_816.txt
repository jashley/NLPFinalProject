it is described as "hi-rail".
as i understand it, it is accepted the rebate will apply to use of diesel fuel in all "on-rail" vehicles for "eligible activities", not only in hi-rail vehicles (which are capable of on-rail and off-rail use).
it is unlikely that such a purchaser would identify purchases as being for either on-rail or off-rail use.
