as mcdougall j said in ingot &amp; ors v macquarie &amp; ors [2004] nswsc 1219 at [21] , the principles stated by heydon j in micallef v ici operations pty ltd &amp; anor [2001] nswca 274 at [63] and [64] need to be taken into account.
however, in black &amp; decker (australasia) pty ltd v gmca pty ltd [2007] fca 1623 , finkelstein j observed at [2] that: [p]arties do incur losses resulting from delay that can never be compensated by a costs order.
at the time of the cadetta deal: (a) the value of the cadetta shares was completely disproportionate to the value of the chameleon shares and the chameleon options offered by chameleon in exchange for those cadetta shares under chameleon's bidder's statement for cadetta as pleaded in paragraph 78 above, and at all events the value of the cadetta tenements in may 2004 was no more than approximately $274,000; (b) in the alternative, if cadetta was not the owner of the cadetta tenements in may 2004, the cadetta shares which chameleon offered to purchase under chameleon's bidder's statement for cadetta were worthless.
