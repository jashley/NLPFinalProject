my associate has contacted the registry of the federal magistrates court.
the respondent noted that proceedings are conducted less formally in the federal magistrates court and referred to the decision in kurniadi v loh (2002) 193 alr 253 ; [2002] fca 1021 at [21] in which carr j observed that appeals from the federal magistrates court were not automatically allocated to a full court but might be dealt with by a single judge (a trend carr j described in 2002 as one occurring with increased frequency).
the parties drew to my attention an outstanding issue raised by sackville j (when he was the docket judge for the matter) about the possible transfer of the proceedings from this court to the federal magistrates court.
