mr pannekoek may have seen these settlement statements at about the time of settlement.
it is not clear whether or not harbeth, through mr pannekoek, had executed the contract before mr reynolds signed it.
in his affidavit sworn 10 march 2008 at [6.2] mr pannekoek said that pa (2004) acted as harbeth's settlement agent.
