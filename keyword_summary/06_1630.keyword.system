mr street sc, who appeared with mr romaniuk for cgu, argues that the proceedings in this court are related to the proceedings brought by mr rich and mr silbermann against cgu in the supreme court.
in 2001 and 2002 respectively, mark alan silbermann ('mr silbermann') and john david rich ('mr rich') filed separate proceedings in the supreme court of new south wales against cgu.
mr rich and mr silbermann rely on the same insurance policy as does the trustee in the proceedings instituted in this court.
