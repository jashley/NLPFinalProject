i consider that such an approach would be consistent with that taken by fitzgerald j in lucic and, because his honour followed lucic , by wilcox j in hunter .
the authority to which wilcox j referred as " chapman " was chapman v reilly , an unreported judgment of neaves j given on 9 december 1983.
it will be seen that this passage identifies the provenance of the formula used by wilcox j in hunter and may be thought to have gone further than the more tentative observations of fitzgerald j in lucic .
