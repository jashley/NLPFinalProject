another issue in your letter that ms nur begum had five childrens (sic) whose names are listed in your letter dated 03 august 2004.
please note that we have been residing in australia since august 2001 and we have been desperately attempting to contact ms nur begum with out any luck.
in addition this (sic) the tribunal does not place any weight on the assertion of the review applicant that nur begum is a common name and that it is just coincidental that this person had the same birthdate.
