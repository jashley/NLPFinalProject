indeed the court is reluctant generally to proceed on this basis: cultivaust pty ltd v grain pool pty ltd [2004] fca 1568 at [40] .
(citations omitted) 4 this approach has been approved by the full court: queensland wire industries pty ltd v broken hill pty co ltd (1987) 17 fcr 211 ; australian competition &amp; consumer commission v australian safeway stores pty ltd (no 2) [2003] fcafc 163 ; and in ruddock v vadarlis (no 2) (2001) 115 fcr 229 at [11].
i do not consider the approach taken by gummow j in nsw dairy corporation to be apt in this case.
