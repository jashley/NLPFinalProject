that application, which was heard in the first instance by sundberg j, alleged that the rrt fell into jurisdictional error by considering out-of-date country information.
the grounds or proposed grounds were (1) the rrt's reliance on out-of-date country information and (2) save before sundberg j, the first appellant's medical condition at the time of the hearing.
before the federal magistrate, the appellants again argued that the rrt had erred by considering out-of-date country information and that there had been a denial of procedural fairness because the first appellant was medically unfit to attend the hearing before the rrt.
