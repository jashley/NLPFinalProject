instead, firstmac has simply taken whatever measures were necessary to gain possession of each of the properties, and then sold them as mortgagee in possession.
the respondents say that had firstmac and subsequently the applicant not resisted production of documents under the subpoena (and in this regard, i should note that firstmac's rights are subrogated to those of the applicant) then the documents under the subpoena could have been produced eight weeks before 23 july 2009.
it therefore is not a reasonable characterisation of the facts to say that the applicant's or firstmac's actions to resist the subpoena caused the late application to amend.
