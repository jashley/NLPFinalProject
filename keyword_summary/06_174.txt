8 telstra argues that seven's imc damages claim provides no justification for opening up a 'collateral investigation of the supposed existence, nature, and quantification of synergies thought to be associated with unexecuted projects'.
the 'pith' of that component is said to be that: '(a) the forced closure of the second applicant [c7], resulting from the alleged anti-competitive conduct of the respondents, impaired [seven's] strategy to become an imc; (b) unimpaired that strategy would have generated synergies between [seven's] various media interests, including their free-to-air and pay television interests; and (c) accordingly, in assessing the loss to [seven] caused by the alleged anti-competitive conduct, it is necessary to take account of the value of these synergies'.
seven says that the documents are relevant, in the requisite sense, to what is said to be the integrated media company ('imc') component of their damages claim.
