in powell v evreniades (1989) 21 fcr 252 (' evreniades ') hill j considered the term as used in s 265 of the income tax assessment act 1936 (cth).
in evreniades, hill j gave such an example when he recognised that there would be 'severe financial hardship' if persons were left 'destitute without any means of support'.
it is because the assessment is based so squarely on the individual circumstances that hill j in evreniades thought it was inappropriate to try and identify, in the abstract, the circumstances that would give rise to serious hardship.
