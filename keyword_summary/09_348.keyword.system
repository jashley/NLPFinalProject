on 26 april 2008 the commissioner published a notice of intention to propose an excise tariff alteration increasing the duty payable on "other excisable beverages" (the excise tariff proposal (no 1) 2008).
section 160b of the excise act expands the meaning of excise tariff and excise tariff alteration by vesting certain powers in the commissioner (referred to as the "ceo" in the excise act ).
the rates for excisable goods are set down in the schedule to the excise tariff act 1921 .
