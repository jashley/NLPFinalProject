the first respondent asks that i make an order pursuant to s 25(2b)(bb)(ii) of the federal court of australia act 1976 (cth) that the appeal be dismissed for failure of the appellant to attend a hearing relating to the appeal.
7 the appellant's failure to appear today, however, and the fact that he has identified in his grounds of appeal no error are factors which i consider sufficient to warrant the exercise of the power under s 25(2b)(bb)(ii) of the federal court of australia act 1976 (cth) to dismiss the appeal for failure of the appellant to attend at today's callover which is a hearing relating to the appeal.
