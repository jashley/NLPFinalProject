the respondent retained a tax agent, mr paul mugridge, to assist him with his tax affairs.
apparently no contact was made with either mr mugridge or the respondent's solicitor, who had relevant information.
mr mugridge completed a business activity statement (bas) for the quarter ending 31 december 2003, confirming that the sale was not subject to gst, and that there was no basis for seeking an input tax credit (itc).
