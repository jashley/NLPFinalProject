the affidavit of ashley john tiplady deposes to those matters.
13 i am making a further guillotine order in terms of that draft order.
i have expressed some reservations about a self-executing guillotine order but having regard to the argument today and the timeframe, it seems to me that some discipline needs to be injected into the resolution of the matter and if it be the case that there is non-compliance and the guillotine order takes effect with the result that it prescribes, then so be it.
