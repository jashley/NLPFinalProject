he arrived in australia on 10 april 2007.
on 19 april 2007 the appellant applied to the department of immigration and citizenship for a protection visa.
the notice of appeal specifies three grounds which may be summarised as follows: - (i) the federal magistrates court should have found that it was open to the tribunal to find that the appellant was a refugee, (ii) the tribunal denied the appellant procedural fairness in respect of his persecution, as a member of the akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad (or abvp), by the communist party of india (marxist) and not the communist party of india (maoist), these being different parties, and (iii) the tribunal's failure to give the appellant accurate particulars of adverse information (namely, about the difference between the communist party of india (marxist) and the communist party of india (maoist)) constituted a jurisdictional error (citing szeeu v minister for immigration, multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs (2006) 150 fcr 214 ; [2006] fcafc 2).
