the tribunal did not put any weight to the document which i submitted before the tribunal that: i) a discharge certificate from the hospital; and reference letters from the shree shree ramkrishna ashram, bangladesh hindu-buddu-christian oikkho parishad, bangladesh chhatra league and bangladesh udichi shilpi gosthi.
however, in assessing the scope of the applicant's engagement in religious activities, the tribunal acknowledged that the applicant may have been committed to religious activities in bangladesh and that he was involved in the work of the group known as the "shree shree ramkrishna ashram".
having reached that conclusion, the tribunal considered that statements from third parties including the "bangladesh hindu-buddu-christian oikkho parishad" indicating that the applicant was an active worker or real believer and a target to extremists, were fabricated and that no weight ought to be attributed to them.
