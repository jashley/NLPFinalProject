in this matter, i have no reasonable cause to believe (on the evidence before me) that the trustee may have failed to act in relation to mr vasiliou's bankruptcy in a manner required by law.
1 on 20 october 2005, the primary judge (marshall j) dismissed an application by the applicant pursuant to s 179 of the bankruptcy act 1966 (cth) ('the act') for the removal of the respondent as his trustee in bankruptcy and ordered that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of and incidental to the application: see vasiliou v marchesi [2005] fca 1471.
