in any case, the full court of this court has held on several occasions that the mere fact that a decision is not logical is not of itself a ground for judicial review: nacb v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2003] fcafc 235 at [29] ; w404/01a of 2002 v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2003] fcafc 255 at [35] ; vwst v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2004] fcafc 286 at [18] .
