3 on 28 may 2001 an application for protection was lodged with the first respondent's department ("the department") in the name of akhtar mohammed waisi, a person claiming to be an afghan national.
in february 2001 he arrived in australia after deserting ship and his long employment as a seaman.
enquiries might have been made of that person as to whether the appellant was in fact the deserting crew member spoken of in the email, amongst other things.
