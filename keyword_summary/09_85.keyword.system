he arrived in australia on 26 april 2003 and applied for a protection visa on 23 may 2003.
the minister sought an order for summary dismissal of the proceedings under s 25(2b)(bb)(ii) of the federal court of australia act 1976 (cth).
under s 36(2) of the act the criterion for a protection visa is that the applicant for the visa is (relevantly) a non-citizen in australia to whom the minister is satisfied australia has protection obligations under the refugees convention as amended by the refugees protocol (meaning, in accordance with s 5(1) , the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 protocol relating to the status of refugees).
