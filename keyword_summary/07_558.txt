6 in each of the 2000 to 2005 income years, the applicant as trustee of the highland trust estate: &#8226; set aside the whole of the trust income for the benefit of gecih; &#8226; retained and remitted to the respondent withholding tax under s 128b of div iia of part iii of the assessment act, at the rate of 10% of the highland trust estate's gross interest income; and &#8226; was liable to and paid income tax upon all of the highland trust estate's income other than interest income.
16 without the intervention of s 128b(3)(h)(ii), the interest income of the highland trust estate, to which gecih was, in the relevant income years, presently entitled, could not be included in the assessable income of the trust estate and could not be taxed pursuant to s 98(3) of the assessment act.
article 11(3) could not assist the respondent, because the usa double tax treaty in defining "permanent establishment" requires in the circumstances of this case that gecih carried on an enterprise through a permanent establishment in australia, which did not occur.
