the third respondent, pnf management pty limited ("pnf management"), has the same directors as pnf systems, mr wilson having resigned on 30 march 2007.
this application in relation to pnf management must therefore be dismissed.
in the case of pnf systems there is an application to wind up, but in the case of pnf management there is not.
