however, in granting the stay his honour decided in effect that those questions should await the hearing and determination of the matter before vcat: see [15]-[16].
his honour ordered that further proceedings in the matter be stayed until the victorian civil and administrative tribunal (vcat) had determined whether an administrator or guardian, or both, should be appointed for the applicant pursuant to a referral to vcat by the county court of victoria under s 66 of the guardianship and administration act 1986 (vic).
it appears from a letter from the office of the victorian government solicitor dated 30 january 2007 that the registrar of the county court will be applying in the supreme court to dissolve or vary the order of bell j and then, subject to the outcome of that application, will apply to vcat to revoke the order dismissing the vcat proceeding.
