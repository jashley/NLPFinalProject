here the question is whether a costs order should be made against the liquidator of jonkay pty ltd (in liq) in an action that was, by leave, brought against the company.
i will set out some extracts: "i consider that i have no role to play in deciding whether the contract that was entered into between jonkay pty ltd and mr jenkins can proceed.
i confirm that i am without funds to seek such advice in the liquidation of jonkay pty limited and that the mortgagee's solicitor has advised that there is no realistic prospect that any funds will become available to the company from any equity after a sale of the property.
