what department or this tribunal will say to cry of indigious fuijians "indians out".
as the tribunal is aware that "fiji" is extensively dominate by the indigious fijians and indians are i minority and i further note that mr mehindra chaudhry ousted prime minister of fiji was noteven safe from the indigious fijians and compare to him i have no status in fiji.
a : i belong to hindu religion and the area where i have lived was extensively dominated by the indigious fijians and it is well documented that there has been a long term tension between hindu and indigious fijians who has never liked us indians in their country.
