the tribunal was not satisfied of a general causal relationship between keying and nerve entrapment (including carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar nerve entrapment).

it concluded that ms butler's carpal tunnel syndrome was not caused by her keying and her ulnar nerve entrapment was not caused by prolonged leaning on her elbow whilst on the telephone at work.
