before the tribunal the appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution because of his activism with the trinamool congress party ('tmc') and its arm known as the 'youth congress of the trinamool dum dum committee'.
moreover the tribunal did accept further evidence from the appellant's migration agent submitted after the hearing, being the letter from the dum dum trinamool yuba congress.
21 the appellant also complained that he was not given an opportunity to respond to the tribunal's concerns about the dum dum trinamool yuba congress letter which he tendered; however, as barnes fm observed, s 422b of the act , szbdf , and szegt v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2005] fca 1514 at [29] (edmonds j) constituted an answer to that suggestion.
