from that time, gih was spassked's creditor in place of ief, but, unlike ief, was not charging spassked interest.
the taxpayer applicants are respectively identified in these reasons as 'ief' (for iel finance limited), 'qth' (for queensland trading &amp; holding company limited) and 'spassked' (for spassked pty limited).
thus each of ief and qth made claims for allowable deductions 'under or through' spassked's entitlement to claim as an allowable deduction the interest expense incurred by spassked as borrower pursuant to the interest bearing loans made to spassked by ief.
