the s 14 determination involved no finding that mr riddle's injury had resulted in death, incapacity for work or impairment.
the tribunal accepted the medical evidence that 'with mr riddle's type of pathology, the onset of symptoms as the applicant experienced, is not necessarily related to trauma or physical activity' (at [93]).
21 in respect of the permanent impairment claim, the tribunal made two relevant findings: at [94]: 'the tribunal was satisfied in relation to mr riddle's back pain, that there was only a temporal, and no causal connection with the employment, and that any permanent impairment suffered on 19 february 2003 was therefore not compensable.
