the scheme provides, in essence, for the merger of ukl with a company, monaro mining nl (monaro), whereby ukl would become a wholly owned subsidiary of monaro and the ukl shareholders would acquire shares in monaro.
at the court hearing for the final approval of the ukl scheme on 16 june 2008, ukl read an affidavit of mr james lewis michael malone, a director of ukl.
the third area is the risk of a penalty being imposed on ukl with the attendant possible diminution in of the assets of ukl and so, of the merged entity.
