it is further alleged that if pearl coast purchased this vessel then cossack would engage pearl coast to fish the "cossack quota".
the number of tags provided to pearl coast by cossack meant that pearl coast could not catch 80% of the quota, 26,000 pearl oysters.
the claims were not limited merely to those against cossack.
