46 in my opinion, the decision of barrett j is to be preferred to the decisions of austin j and campbell j for the reasons given by barrett j.
in his reasons, barrett j relied upon a decision of davies j in federal commissioner of taxation v all suburbs car repairs pty ltd (1994) 14 acsr 753.
45 that decision was followed by gyles j in purchas v estore pty ltd (in liq) [2006] fca 1222 ; (2006) 154 fcr 246.
