this inference is supported by mr greenhalgh's evidence.
according to railcorp, the facts in jordan v mornington inn pty ltd (2007) 166 ir 33 ; [2007] fca 1384 (affirmed in mornington inn pty ltd v jordan (2008) 168 fcr 383 ; [2008] fcafc 70) are distinguishable.
this is demonstrated by mr greenhalgh's evidence of railcorp's ad hoc approach and the factual summary in [100]-[105] and [119]-[170] of my principal reasons for judgment.
