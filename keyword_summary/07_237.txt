8 i am satisfied that dr coyte's evidence was contrived by the treloar direction.
that direction was given after dr coyte had been asked by mr wiegand in oral examination about whether his employment did or did not contribute materially to his condition, to which dr coyte replied: "one would have to define what degree of contribution is material".
7 it clearly was the case in the present matter that dr coyte, the medical practitioner whose evidence the tribunal accepted, gave his evidence concerning what matters contributed in a material degree to mr wiegand's condition after being directed by the tribunal in accordance with the less exacting treloar test.
