the tribunal did not consider the applicant as being a sikh in the context of india generally, that is, a sikh in the context of being a sikh from the punjab state.
clearly, the question of being a sikh and being a landowner was considered by the tribunal.
one could ask rhetorically perhaps, what essentially is the difference between being persecuted as a member of the social group of sikh landowners and being a member of the social group of punjabi sikh jatt landowners?
