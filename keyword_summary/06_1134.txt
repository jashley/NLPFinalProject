cosdean is a small one-shareholder company.
it is first necessary for ffa (the applicant on the motion) to establish that cosdean will be unable to pay its costs if cosdean is unsuccessful in the action.
i propose to make an order that cosdean provide to ffa security for costs in the sum of $40,000.
