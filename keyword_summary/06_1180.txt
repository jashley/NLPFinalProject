my decision does not relate to any documents held by mr pinder or by pump technology pty ltd.
in australian securities and investments commission v southcorp ltd (2003) 46 acsr 438 ( southcorp ), lindgren j at [21] identified a number of principles applicable.
the applicants seek an order for inspection of a document discovered only in a list of documents filed on 20 july 2006, in which it is described as 'draft report prepared by barry pinder of pump technology pty ltd dated 7 august 1995' (the report).
