mr mccredie said he did not recall.
this appears to be technically incorrect as mr nathan asked mr mccredie about whether he said to mr nathan that the monthly repayment provided comprehensive and loan insurance.
i think that is the context in which his honour was critical of mr nathan in his questioning of mr mccredie.
