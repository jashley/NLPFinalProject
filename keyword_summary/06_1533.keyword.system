1 on 26 october 2006, i gave judgment in this matter: auspine staff superannuation pty ltd v henderson [2006] fca 1281.
the complainant, however, has pointed out that the passage from the judgment of toohey j, upon which goldberg j relied, gave endorsement also to the following statement by jacobs j in cretazzo (13 sasr at 16): the ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is dissuaded by the risk of costs from canvassing all issues, however doubtful, which might be material to the decision of the case.
18 in the result, i am not persuaded that there is any legitimate basis upon which i should depart from the usual rule that costs follow the event.
