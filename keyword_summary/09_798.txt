it is true that the appellants have not prosecuted the appeals with alacrity.
in so far as the appeals were brought by mr tracy and sunstate citrus, i did so with their consent.
on 24 july 2009 i made orders dismissing appeals brought by citrus queensland pty ltd (in liquidation), mr peter tracy and sunstate citrus pty ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement).
