in the course of proceedings before me, mr judd, senor counsel for awb, confirmed that awb does not seek to assert any claim of legal professional privilege over the documents.
this consideration outweighs the remote risk of any prejudice to awb.
(d) a little later that day mr owbridge sent an email to awb's solicitors stating that the documents would be published at 5.00pm on 8 august 2006, pending awb's claims for commercial confidentiality.
