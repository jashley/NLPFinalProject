(see: szeeu and others v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2006] fcafc 2 ; (2006) 150 fcr 214.
therefore if the decision was based on reasoning that was flawed (minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs v khawar 67 ald 577, dranichnikov v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs 73 ald 321) or on facts that did not exist (minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs v rajamanikram 69 ald 275) the decision was liable to be set aside on the ground of jurisdictional error.
this line of authority was not disturbed in szeeu : see at 235 (moore j), 254 (weinberg j) and 295 (allsop j).
