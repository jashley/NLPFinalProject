mr knackstredt, who appeared for the first respondent (the "minister") also offered substantial assistance.
the matter was eventually argued at length, limited to the cross-examination question.
the court received great assistance from mr jones who had advised the appellant pursuant to my reference and appeared pro bono for him.
