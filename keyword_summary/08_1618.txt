the pleaded facts 7 the relevant pleaded facts and contentions as against these respondents are that: &#8226; at all relevant times until 2 january 2002, the registered owner of the property was ladell pty ltd (ladell).
thereafter the registered proprietor of the property was mr spencer; &#8226; the bankrupt was director and secretary of ladell; &#8226; on or about 1 july 1999, ladell granted an initial charge called the 'ladell charge' to these respondents; &#8226; in or about july 2001, the bankrupt entered into a so-called oral 'front man agreement' with mr spencer.
for the purposes of the argument, it is accepted that the bankrupt controlled ladell so while no issue is taken for present purposes concerning the bankrupt's control of ladell, the question is how mr spencer as registered proprietor at the relevant time could effect a transfer by the bankrupt.
