1 this is an application for leave to appeal against a judgment of the federal magistrates court of 26 september 2008 ( szjoh v minister for immigration &amp; anor [2008] fmca 1401).
consistent with the analysis of authorities in szgap v minister for immigration &amp; multicultural &amp; indigenous affairs (2005) 227 alr 683 ; [2005] fca 1785 , summary dismissal of an appeal, without any final adjudication on the merits, is an interlocutory rather than a final decision.
