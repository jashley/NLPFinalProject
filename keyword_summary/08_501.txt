what, if any, is the relevance of the applicant claiming to be a jatt?
his honour noted that in the appellant's response to the s 424a letter the appellant said he was persecuted for being a punjabi sikh jatt landowner.
one could ask rhetorically perhaps, what essentially is the difference between being persecuted as a member of the social group of sikh landowners and being a member of the social group of punjabi sikh jatt landowners?
