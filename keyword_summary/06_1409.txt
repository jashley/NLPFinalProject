(2) disclosure of the documents 29 the applicant does not contend that the disclosure of the documents by the staff of the oflc, as secretariat to the review board, to the attorney-general's department constitutes a waiver of privilege --- accepting, rightly or wrongly, that there is no such waiver by force of the combined operation of the legal services directions 2005 (cl 10.1) and subs 55zh(1) and (4) of the judiciary act but contends that the disclosure of the documents by the attorney-general's department to the ags solicitor for the attorney-general does constitute such a waiver.
however, i see this issue not so much as an extension of the principle enunciated in waterford but an attempt to carve out of the reasoning processes of the members of the high court in that case, an exception which is not there; in other words, to read what their honours said as containing some implied exception so that it is not to be read as applying to staff involved with statutory boards or tribunals, such as staff of the oflc, the statutory agency which provides secretariat support to the review board.
