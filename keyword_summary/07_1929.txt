the tying clause as set out in clause 4.1 of foxtel's daa has the practical effect of not obliging foxtel to supply the digital set top unit service to homes where the digital set top unit service is not in use by a foxtel subscriber.
given that foxtel subscribers must take foxtel's basic package to receive the foxtel service and be provided with an stu, access seekers are only able to supply their services as a tiered channel to foxtel's basic package.
they relate only to circumstances where a current foxtel subscription is in place but have nothing to say about non-subscribers.
