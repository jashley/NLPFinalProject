first, the tribunal did not find that the appellant was an activist; it found that he was a low-level awami league supporter.
the appellant claimed to have well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of his membership of the bangladesh awami league.
the tribunal failed to consider: the risk of persecution that forced the appellant to leave bangladesh; the appellant was a credible witness; failing to judge whether persecution of awami league members occurs under the existing regime; that the opponent political activists are specific targets of the fundamentalist political party jamat e-islam and the bnp who have formed a coalition.
