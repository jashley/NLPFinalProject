on 14 august 2009, i gave judgment in default in favour of the australian communication and media authority (the authority) against, materially, the fourth respondent, mr simon anthony owen.
other items of personal furniture also seem to be being offered for sale via the internet by mr owen.
the amount of the authority's costs has yet to be quantified, either by taxation or agreement with, materially, mr owen.
