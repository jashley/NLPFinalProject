the notions of removal and deportation refer to removal or deportation from australia: see the definitions of "remove" and "deportation" in s 5 of the act.
similar observations are applicable to s 151 in my view, and see, to a similar effect, in the matter of an application by solomon barudea for a warrant under s 151(1) of the migration act 1958 (cth) [1995] vsc 55 at [22] .
