i find, therefore, that the reviewable decision before the tribunal does take in the psychological condition of mr buhr as at 1 december 2004.
it follows that the tribunal may properly consider mr buhr's condition as at 1 december 2004 and events after the introduction of [the src act] .
whether it worsened to the extent of a delusional disorder or paranoid personality disorder or other, the decision under review, made on 1 december 2004, properly took in the continuing claims of mr buhr about his psychological condition.
