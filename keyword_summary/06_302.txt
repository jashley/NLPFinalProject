2 the nature of the accc's allegations is that the second respondent, mr hilder, used the first respondent, the original mama's pizza and ribs pty ltd ('the company'), and the services of the third respondent, mr soo, as a vehicle and means of selling pizza oven systems to various people who wished to use the pizza oven systems in food outlets.
finally, mr ramrakha submitted that, although the accc exercised its powers to interview mr hilder, and also had the opportunity to speak to mr soo, and some generalised allegations were put to them, they were not asked about the allegations in the particular cases now brought to the court.
mr hilder is not selling pizza oven systems following an indication from the accc that it would maintain a very lively interest in his activities if he sought to do so.
