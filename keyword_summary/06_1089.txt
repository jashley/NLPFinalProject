the tribunal described the particular social group as ' an unnamed support group which informed and educated women [in mongolia] about life overseas '.
it can be taken from the context of the tribunal's decision that those women the appellant was informing and educating were women at risk of people trafficking in mongolia by organised crime groups.
the country information included the response of the department of foreign affairs and trade to a series of questions apparently asked by the tribunal concerning the status of women trafficking in mongolia ('the response').
