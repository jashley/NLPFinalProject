it seems clear to me on settled authority that the appellant bears the onus of establishing the relevant matters ( szhyp v minister for immigration and citizenship (2007) fca 183).
the applicant is a carpenter by trade.
by his own admission, he was a timber tradesman who was gainfully employed with an advertisement and renovations company before he left china to come to australia.
