my view is consistent with that of moore j in merck &amp; co inc v genrx pty ltd (2006) 70 ipr 286.
prior to november 2003 genrx business an unincorporated unit of faulding and then mayne; &#8226; 20 january 2004: proceedings commenced in the korean intellectual property tribunal; &#8226; 28 april 2004: canadian proceedings commenced; &#8226; 1 july 2004: genrx acquired by apotex australia pty ltd which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of apotex inc of canada; &#8226; 27 june 2006: genrx submits bioequivalents and bioavailability data for its clopidogrel 75 mg (as hydrogen sulphate) tablets to the secretary, commonwealth department of health and ageing; &#8226; 30 june 2006: date of expiration of data exclusivity period; &#8226; 16 august 2007: application for revocation filed by genrx; &#8226; 17 august 2007: genrx obtained registration of clopidogrel 75 mg tablets; &#8226; 17 august 2007: genrx advised sanofi of filing of application for revocation.
if that had taken place the case, including any appeals, would have been resolved well before 17 august 2007.
