the first appellant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution arising from his membership of and activities with the bjp political party and that he had left india because of a fear of harm from a local muslim gang leader, abdul kadar.
the facsimile attached a medical certificate stating that the first appellant was unfit to attend the hearing due to mastoiditis in his right ear.
the tribunal (at [58]-[62]) concluded that the first appellant was not a credible witness and that certain "inconsistencies, contradictions and implausibility" in his claims (at [58]) meant that the tribunal was not satisfied "that the [first appellant] was targeted by [abdul kadar and others in india] or that he suffered physical, mental or financial harm because of his involvement with bjp" (at [60]).
