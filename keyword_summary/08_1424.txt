in relation to the evidence provided to dr lethlean, the frequency of headaches seems to have reduced from 1994 to october 2005 when the applicant was examined by dr lethlean.
neurologists dr beran (exhibit 3 folio 157) and dr lethlean (exhibit 1 folio 70) both diagnosed tension headaches.
that finding puts the position rather higher than did dr lethlean, who saw sleep apnoea as a "possible" cause of mr bryant's headaches.
