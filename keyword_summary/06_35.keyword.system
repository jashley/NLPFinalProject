on 11 april 2005 the tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs ("the minister") refusing to grant the appellant a protection visa.
the gist of the appellant's claim was that he incurred the wrath of his uncle for not marrying his uncle's daughter and for marrying a christian not of the same class.
reliance was placed on the observations of lee j in wagh v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs [2003] fcafc 194 ; (2003) 131 fcr 269 at 278, which might be viewed as indicating that it is necessary for there to be a prior acceptance or acknowledgement by a third country to enliven s 36(3) of the act.
